Why does Open in a New Window sometimes us the letter 'N' and sometimes 'W'?,When using a right click menu with a mouse it would be helpful to always us 'W' for window and 'T' for tab. Besides being easy to remember they are both on the right side of the keyboard and you can keep your hand on the mouse.

Firefox hangs / high CPU use when trying to open a local file,"I mean, that's it. If I try, through any means* to open a local HTML file or folder, that tab churns forever, spins up high CPU use, unresponsive to any form of interaction, and has to be killed using task manager. Means tried include: - in FF: File, Open, select an HTML file. - in FF: use ""file://c:/"" - from Windows Explorer: context menu, ""open with"" -> Firefox - from Windows Explorer: drag HTML file to Firefox address barWindows 10 64-bit (does Win10 even have 32-bit?), FF 62.0 64-bit, middling late-model Dell laptop (16GB memory, i5-7300U, Intel graphics)."

"How to stop the many many outbound connections beyond those addressed in the ""How to stop Firefox from making automatic connections"" page?","I just installed a PortableApps version of firefox 52.9.0 (32 bit) ESR. On startup it tries to make numerous outbound connections. They are mostly to Mozilla IP addresses I think. Some of the IP addresses are LIKE these (these plus slight variations on these):54.191.46.2854.187.147.16735.166.127.14852.34.90.2335.166.127.148I have no add-ons or extensions installed.I have set up privacy as much as I could to prevent outbound connections.I have gone through Mozilla's webpage ""How to stop Firefox from making automatic connections"" and done all of that stuff.So I would like to prevent all these unwanted outbound connections.I am also curious what would be contained in all these packets that ff is sending to these addresses.Thanks!"
Something starts happening after two hours or so on Firefox - WHAT IS IT?,"For over a year now, I have experienced the 'phenomenon' that after between two and three hours of browsing, the whole of Firefox just grinds to a halt. I have tried all the various suggestions but nothing works.I have a large number of tabs, because they are all regularly used in my family history research, I am moving between web sites all the time to gain information, capture screen shots from Trove, and update data on Ancestry and MyHeritage, particularly, I am also switching to other programs regularly, e.g. Photoshop Elements, Excel and Word.As a retired programmer, and amateur web site developer, I am wondering whether the browser is doing some activity such as indexing across all tabs, or refreshing of all tabs, after two hours - if so I am seeking some way to disable this activity, which I don't want to happen, because it is just annoying and wasting precious time in a life timetable which is rapidly coming near to its end.Along similar lines of frustration I am also experiencing that if I leave the browser open and go away to have a meal (for maybe 1 to 2 hours or even sometimes as little as 10 to 15 minutes) it is nearly never possible to get Firefox to just start up again when I go to access a tab in the session that I left open. Very often Firefox crashes in such situations, while on other occasions it just takes maybe as much as half an hour for it to get back up to pace, so to say. Again - Is Firefox doing some background tasks? I do not want Firefox to do any background tasks of ANY KIND. I simply want a browser that shows me the page when I request it and then leaves it alone, no automatic refreshing, no indexing, no nothing - simple page display. I only want refreshing when I ask for it.Finally, this last point is maybe Firefox related, maybe Ancestry related, maybe OS related, I am not sure, but again it is something to do with Firefox not doing the basics, but seemingly doing lots of other things that I do not want it to do. Often when I add information to a record that is open on a tab in Ancestry, the re-display of the tab, with the updated information, does not come back up with its proper name, e.g. ""Philip Mark Hunt"", instead it just comes up as ""Ancestry Person"". It is as though the reloading of the tab has hit some kind of timeout, so it just defaults to a general name rather than the true tab name."

reset password on university website that uses windows authentication,"I attend University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, UAFS. Every few months they require students to change their passwords, this is fine on campus, but at home when it changes I have to retype the username and password every time I want to log in and there is no one else here to compromise my computer. I had to recently reload my computer after it crashed, the first time I had to fill it in was fine and since reloading the OS it remembers the information, but when I have to change my password , I have until Oct 2nd, and the authentication window appears and I change what is in it to log in, then the next time after that I will have to retype the info everytime I log in. This will happen until I either have to reload windows or get a new computer. My question: is there a way to reset this so that I don't have to retype it ever single time after I have to change it. I didn't know where to start asking this and I realize you may not be the ones to ask but I was hoping you could give me some insight. Thank you!"

turn off update message after firefox 62,"As of about firefox 63, it will no longer be possible to prevent firefox from checking for updates as the preference (option) to do so is being removed.

how to disable autoupdate of firefox 52>60esr? its important! I don't care why you stop supporting 52esr - it's the only one browser that allows me work,"Governments and their agencies are in no hurry to update their websites and web applications. 52 esr is the only one version of your browser that works with such ""hurdles"". To suggest the transition in IE and Edge is not necessary, they are not working with some sites. Where they can be used - and we do. The situation is very unpleasant we have to use 4 different browsers for different tasks and your demarche deprives us of one of the most important. To expect governments best response to changes of the surrounding world is naive. Please ask users to update or not their version of firefox. Thanks. Yet we must smash 60 esr and reinstall 52 esr daily."

"When sites ask me to ""agree"" to cookies, how do I ""disagree""?","In recent years, I keep seeing prompts at the top of the page telling me I need to ""agree"" to cookies.First of all - what are these prompts called and why have they started appearing so commonly?But I was mostly wondering - how do I DISAGREE with cookies? There's never a disagree button.And is there any real point to agreeing (or disagreeing), since not all sites even bother to ask, so I presume they don't need your permission to use cookies?"
Changing the Input Language to Japanese freezes Firefox,"When I change to Japanese input, Firefox ""stops responding"" for a few seconds. This is consistent.I change my inputs from ENG to Chinese to Japanese and back to English, but the freeze only happens when switching to Japanese. I use the shortcut Alt + Shift to cycle through my inputs, but the problem remains when I select Japanese directly. Selecting Mandarin does not manifest this problem.When I restart Firefox, the problem goes away for a while before it comes back."
Notes missing from bookmarks in new version of Firefox,"It looks like i'm not the only one upset with the newest update. Will the problem with the hidden data be fixed?From what i have been able to learn, the information we had stored in the ""Properties"" tab is still in the Mozilla system but now hidden. I'm guessing the Key word box is its replacement, but i cant get to the hidden tab to make the transfer. How about giving us the option to transfer from Properties to Key Word?I found the Properties tab very useful for my website information and am feeling very much at a loss.I would sure appreciate an answer or a tip that solves the problem.Ive never done this before so dont know where i will find the response, so guidance on that will be appreciated as well."

Is there a way to setup a keyword shortcut when creating a bookmark?,"This is something that has been driving me crazy in Firefox for a long time and I don't understand why this isn't a standard feature. One of my favorite features is the ability to create custom bookmark keywords for my bookmarks. This is normally done by opening your bookmarks, right click --> properties and there you have the option. This is very cumbersome and my wish is to be able to set these keywords right when I'm first creating the bookmark. There used to be an old extension that allowed this functionality. There also was a way to do it by modifying userChrome.css see here: https://lifehacker.com/5738698/add-bookmark-keywords-to-firefox-from-the-address-barNow when I try this userChrome.css method it doesn't seem to be working for me. I can see the keyword field when creating a bookmark, but it's not saving my changes. I really wish this was a core feature and not something I have to hack into firefox everytime I start a fresh install. Bookmark keywords is a great feature, and I don't understand why the devs make it so inconvenient to use."

I want to be able to stay on the original screen while opening 1 or several new links in new tabs that do NOT take the focus away from the first page. Then I can view those new tabs when I'm ready.

Problems with beta outlook email and Moziila -- Still Happening with Other Users,"I am repeating the issue that was stated then 'closed' a few days ago, even though there are at least 2 of us 'out there' who are still experiencing the exact same problem: I use Outlook email, and they changed me over to beta. Ever since, when I try to scroll down and check my email list, the screen keeps bouncing up to the top emails. It's impossible to scroll down to the lower ones. (They took away the option to switch out of beta.)Not only am I having the exact same problem, which started at the exact same time as the original note -- in September 2018, when Outlook 'permanently' changed service to what had previously been optional 'beta' -- I have now also stepped through each Mozilla troubleshooting step (1 thru 6+) & it has not resolved the frustrating behavior. I opened a case and have completed troubleshooting with Microsoft; they've pointed me to the ""3rd party browser"" for further troubleshooting.I am having no trouble whatsoever with Chrome, IE, or the Outlook Android app. It is ONLY happening (as described at the outset) when using Hotmail, transitioned from the beta with no way of returning to classic, when attempting to view my email account via the Mozilla browser.I sure hope you're able to dig into this further on your side: I would really prefer to use Firefox than another browser.Thank you!"

FF excessive memory usage,"I been noticing lately alot of posting of FF excessive RAM usage or Taxing on the system Resources. My best guess here is that FF during the Auto updates has become corrupted from either the update or some other software causing the update error thus leading to excessive RAM usage causing system freezing or unresponsive Browser or making the computer in General slow and unresponsive.Below is what one should really do in order to eliminate if the Browser is the culprit to the problem.1. Download the latest version of FF based on your O/S version 32bit to 32bit Browser or 64bit O/S to 64bit Browserhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/2. Backup your BookMark if you have one created or any CSS style you added as well3. Write down any Addons/Extensions so you can find and download them later4. Uninstall all FF installs and Deleted the Mozilla folder5. Restart6. Reinstall the new FF and then update with the Addons/Extensions7. Restore your BookMark back.8. Run FF to see if the problem returns or notNow if you do all this and still have problems then it's not a FF issue but something related to either adblockers, A/V being to aggressive or Malware/Virus is present and blocking any Browser from working correctly. And this point would require a Computer shop to resolve the problem."

Since I Reset Firefox no new passwords are saved,I Reset Firefox because it was slow and I was getting many 'not responding' freeze ups. It worked and my system is much faster now. I reinstalled adblocker and send to mail and changed the theme back to light from the default.I also changed the security setting to Save Logins. Today I find that all my saved logins are no longer there but I put that down to the Reset and decided it was probably time I set up new passwords. I have entered password reset a couple of sites and said yes to save the login when the pop up window appears. When I returned to the sites later to login it had not remembered the logins. When I check the Saved Logins there is nothing saved.Have I missed a setting or is there a problem.

Found an attack site. Thought of way to prevent successful attack. (Feature Suggestion),"I went to the site at this link (DO NOT CLICK!!!):http:// 134.249.116.78 /index.php The URL Google said the link would lead to is this: www. javcolor .com/ytvvo4l/npeeo6is.php?dtjfygku=embed...It tried to brute force open dialogs to get me to download something and kept popping up all sorts of crap. It prevented me from closing the tab by opening up endless dialogs. I finally was able to close the tab by pressing ESC rapidly. So my suggestion is to allow closing the current tab even if a dialog has focus in the application. This would not allow a website to pop up save dialogs and other dialogs preventing you from closing the tab. Honestly with the current architecture of applications I am not sure this is possible if the dialog is modal. So I guess is there any kind of emergency mechanism to prevent this kind of thing already? I have pop ups blocked in Firefox settings. I just have never seen a someone abuse the save file dialog like this.Perhaps I need some third party plugin to protect myself from this. I used to run Noscript, but ran into issues with usability of websites. I also got weary of having to enable servers all the time."

Firefox takes a long time until it starts with loading a new page,"Hello,since the last update (v63.0, Windows) I have an issue that makes Firefox not usable. I hope you can help me.Every time I open a new webpage, over a hyperlink or manually, Firefox takes 5-8 seconds until it starts to load the page. It seems like Firefox does nearly nothing at this point, there is no traffic going out, no CPU usage etc. There is also no status message in the bottom left corner like ""Waiting for https://foobar.com..."". After 5-8 seconds Firefox starts to load the page and then it goes very fast.This makes it impossible to use Firefox, because normal activities take a lot of time, because every click takes 5-8 seconds. On chrome on the same PC everything is OK.I already did nearly everything to reset and clear my Firefox installation, I reinstalled and deleted the Mozilla folder in the AppData directory, the problem still persists. My colleague has the same issue since this update, so it's not only my PC.I hope you can help me."

It just started closing upon minimization this morning. How do I get it back to how it was? I will have to use a different browser if there is no fix for this and I really don't want to do that.I should also add that Firefox had been pinned to my taskbar. This morning it was gone and I had to re-pin it there. But it doesn't matter whether I open it from the taskbar or from the menu, it shuts down when I minimize. Please help!I also just noticed that even if I don't minimize it, if I do anything else on my computer it closes and I have to completely restart it. I absolutely can't work this way. For example, if I leave it open and then open my Word document, when I try to go back to Firefox it has closed and has to re-start. All the information I just researched is gone. I'm very, very frustrated."
Cannot copy multiple links from Media tab of the Page Info window on OS X,"If I open the Page Info window and go to the Media tab I can see many links for the assets of a given page, and I can select multiple items. However, I cannot copy these items to clipboard as the ""copy"" option is greyed out on the context menu as well as the main navbar dropdown. The respective keyboard shortcut ⌘C is also disabled and does nothing. I *can* copy a single link at a time - copy function only stops working when multiple items are selected. I'd simply like to copy that list of links to a text editor. How can this be done and why am not not able to copy these links?Based on my earlier question (which went unanswered and is now archived / https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1209191 ) I have concluded that this is OS X specific and have since tested on Windows and Ubuntu which are both able to copy multiple links without any problem.I've also filed a bug report here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452537 which has had zero activity or response.

More detailed info on tracking protection,"I understand the basic concepts of tracking protection but I've been unable to find answers to a few specific questions. I found some documentation here in the questions / answers section but it didn't provide all the answers. 1. Do I need to clear existing cookies to remove the myriad of sites already tracking me before turning on tracking protection? Or, will turning it on do an immediate filter on my existing cookies? 2. Will turning off tracking stop sites that I want to retain login information for from retaining the ""login"" cookie infor i.e. are we close to a full ""cookie block"" with anti-tracking? Or does FFox have some creative algorithm (or list) that allows it to distinguish between tracking cookies and less offensive cookies? Concurrently, is there a way to allow a ""tracking cookie"" if I need it to retain information for a site I'm comfortable with?3. One specific tracking question: Will eliminating tracking cookies stop (specifically) Google's cross site advertising, where you look at a product on site A (who shares that info via google) and then a little later google's advertising mechanism pops up those products when you're at site B?"

If it helps, most recently it happened on Visa Checkout pop-up for Ticketmaster. I didn't want to repeat the process in Edge as I would lose my tickets so instead I opted to reset password. I tried my old password and lo and behold, it said I cannot use my current password. Then... why didn't you let me in?

Will Saved Password Editor ever work again?,"The Saved Password Editor (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saved-password-editor/) was an excellent extension and highly useful extension, rendered inoperative by Quantum. While some people may think that this extension is no longer needed because of the built-in editor (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1186297) this is incorrect for a number of reasons: Some website don't capture the login information and there is no way to manually enter the information: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234322. Editing some json file is a ridiculous suggestion. It annoying to navigate to the built-in editor and recently FF moved the ""saved logins..."" button down about:preferences#privacy so you now have to scroll in addition to clicking. Note: bookmarking chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul is handy, but doesn't solve the other problems. The built-in editor does not allow editing the website URL or duplicating a login. All of this make it impossible to use the built-in password editor to save things like PINs or answers to secret questions, all of which was very easy with the Saved Password Editor extension.So will Firefox ever enable the Saved Password Editor to work again? The add-on page says that the extension needs a WebExtensions API. Will Firefox ever have one of those again? If the functionality was added into the build-in password manager, that would be good, too. Thank you."

"MacBook 2.2 GHz Core Duo with 4GB 667 MHz DDR2 DRAM running version 10.7.5 no longer supports Firefox, any suggestions that would allow me to update Firefox?",My question describes the problem. I have this old MacBook I travel with and want to see if there are things I can do to it so that I can update Firefox which probably requires me to be able to update the operating system to El Capitain.

Firefox now has ad blocker and it causes issues with sites I visit. I don't know how to modify it; I am not using in private browsing. It's on all the time.,"I no longer see ads when I read email, look at a magazine or newspaper article etc. Some sites don't like this and won't let me view what's on them because I am blocking ads. I have looked at Options>Privacy and Security>Tracking Protection and it is not turned on. It is only on when I use a privacy window which I am not using. I have no idea where to look to be able to modify this. I have cookies enabled.I will admit I have far fewer crashes now that the ads do not display in email and I am happy about that but when a site I belong to won't let me read there because ads are blocked that becomes a problem. Do I have any control over this feature? I only use Firefox on my pc that runs Win 7 Professional and I use version 60.3 esr 32 bit because I still run into situations where Java is required and it was explained in an earlier question that I should use Firefox esr because of this."
black screen of death (ksod),"I have a new Dell Inspiron 7373 released in October 2017 with 8th generation i7 and Intel 620 graphics...This is a new problem from sometime around (before?) the release of Quantum...

I have tried disabling hardware acceleration and uninstalling/reinstalling the Intel graphics driver (which is not testable for long since Windows Update re-installs it almost immediately, though I could try disabling wuauserv in the services manager...)I also reinstalled Firefox and refreshed my profile, and tried running the browser in with the add-ons disabled......Please adviseThank you for your time and consideration"

"When on www.nytimes.com, Firefox pop-up stating ""This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved."" appears.","Starting this morning, whenever I click on a link on www.nytimes.com, a pop-up appears that says ""This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved."" and requires that I either click ""Stay on Page"" or ""Leave Page"". I have never seen this before and it only seems to happen on www.nytimes.com. Has anyone else had this issue? If so, how can I make it go away? Is there something that may have changed in Firefox Preferences with the most recent update? See attached screen shot."
Sound in videos continually goes out. There's also several warning signs of padlock w/exclamation mark. How can i change that even if risky sites Per FF,"Hello, I think my problem is when i pull up some videos. Now on the site itself for instance, one video plays fine while another doesn't. It's trusting site and it's probably videos that are recorded different equipment as the host will interview different people. So, then the exclamation in the padlock appears and then no sound. One time i unmuted all the sound mixer's icons at the bottom but still couldn't get the sound. I just ""refreshed"" the FF so it should be fine. I am trying to see how to manipulate the settings to lose the exclaimation mark on the padlock when i trust the site so as to, of course, avoid this setting whenever i just start to find interest in video and then bam-no sound. Thanks if you can provide any solutions to try.Keith Leisure"

"when ever I run Firefox.exe I get an error of ""The data is invalid"" but if I rename firefox.exe to firefox1.exe it runs with no problems.","Ever since Firefox nightly did an update a few days ago, I have been unable to run it from the normal shortcut. I had to make a copy of the exe and rename it and only then would it work from the renamed file. If I click a link in Thunderbird, for example it still looks for Firefox.exe and not the renamed file. If I change the tile to Firefox.exe.bak so that only Firefox1.exe is accessible, I still have to run it manually from that new file name rather than the default. This is a new install of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate and this is the only time I have ever had problems with nightly. Now, when I restart the browser, it downloads a new firefox.exe and the error returns. I would rather try and fix the problem than remove all traces of it then reinstall, that would be like ignoring the problem and starting over which won't 'fix' the error that others might have."

"Firefox 63 - tabs crash VERY frequently on websites requiring computation (e.g., Google Doc/Drive) in Ubuntu 18.04","Hey everyone, My tabs keep consistently crashing on specific websites, it's hard for me to describe since I'm not an expert, but it's pages where there's some sort of heavier processing going on - like running Google Docs or sometimes just doing like a Captcha or uploading documents. Gmail also crashes VERY frequently. I've been putting up with it for a while since tabs usually reload quickly, but I'd love to get this figured out since I'm increasingly relying on Google Drive for work.Important to note that I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 which is otherwise completely stable. Firefox is also the most stable web browser available for me. I have tried several solutions that have worked for other people:-I tried setting browser.tabs.remote.autostart to FALSE and that actually led to the entire firefox program crashing instead of tabs! Weird. And worse, so I set it back to TRUE. -I updated my graphics drivers, I have an Intel® HD Graphics 520 (Skylake GT2) graphics card, I updated using this link https://launchpad.net/~paulo-miguel-dias/+archive/ubuntu/pkppa/, which seemed to help only momentarily.-I have disabled hardware acceleration. This actually made no difference at all. -I have disabled WebGL but it didn't make much of a difference. webgl.disabled is currently set to FALSE since it didn't help. My computer has had some larger mysterious problems that forced me to switch to Ubuntu from Windows, I suspect it has something to do with my GPU but I don't really know. Anyway if someone has suggestions on how I can be more specific with describing the problem, please let me know. Thank you for your time!"

Bring back Bookmark Descriptions lost in 62.0,"There have been large discussions about Bookmark Descriptions. There are some awkward workarounds but Bookmarks are essentially a hierarchical data base with Notes/Description capability. Web site logons are getting very, very complex with many keywords and alternate authentications. The description field was the best way to remember and store all of these keywords and unique ways to search that particular web page. It worked extremely well before it was removed. In what release will the Bookmark Description field be reinstated?"

"add-on search results listing should show permissions per result, without having to check each separately, please.","Many people avoid add-ons that require certain permissions, more often if there is no public source. It would be advantageous to the user to be able to more conveniently avoid add-ons that do not require permissions they deem inappropriate.If the permission list was given, per add-on, in the add-on search results list, the user would be able to find the self-appropriate add-ons without having to look through them all. (e.g. 58 results for youtube adblock"")This would help promote those who create add-ons that are intentionally less intrusive, which is 100% fair and a good thing.Another step could be to indicate, in the search results, whether source is open publicly available. That goes a long way toward creating trust and fostering business and success.This would help promote those who create add-ons that are more open. Another individual's request was to filter the add-on search results by user-selected permissions. That would be great. Might be more work and for a later version but for now I think this request is not too hard (said every hardware engineer ever).Thanks!"

Firefox crashes,"ID: a2c13d00-c35a-41b9-add1-45c2a0181206Every time I try to upload a file to WordPress, Firefox crashes when the pop up window opens to browse my files. Besides the fact that this problem never happened before this week, the odd thing was, on one attempt, I tried to locate a file - and though Firefox crashed yet again- it crashed AFTER I selected the file and actually uploaded it. Every attempt before and after it crashed before I could even select a file. And it didn't crash when I tried to upload an image here! But I also notice the file isn't appearing in the uploaded images window below, the upload icon is circling in ""the endless loop of death"". Could it be that WordPress did something to their program because they are about to launch what they're calling an ""upgrade""? or did microsuck issue another ""upgrade"" during last weekend and wreck everything again?"

Firefox tab hangs,"A while back I started having problems with tabs hanging in Firefox. This happens arbitrarily, in any site, without any user input.

The only solution is for me to kill that process.I'm seeing this in two different computers, work and home. The usage pattern between these two is quite different, although I do have Firefox sync in both of them. I've tried deleting my profile (rm -rf ~/.mozilla/) but that hasn't helped. I've tried using safe mode and couldn't reproduce the error, but since these crashes happen about twice a day it's hard to say for sure.

Lately, every time I open FF, I am advised that FF is not my default browser. Then, I set it to the default in Windows/Settings/Apps. But after I close FF and reopen it, I'm again prompted that FF is not the default browser. So I go through the process yet again.Could there be some Windows registry setting? I created second profile and copied the bookmarks, cert8/9 files over from the original profile, and I installed the same extensions. However, the issue occurs in my new profile as well. Thanks for any suggestions."

I can't restore my tabs after updating to ff63,"For some reason it updated without asking/notifying me about it. Then after it restarted it reset EVERYTHING. I don't see the Apps anymore, the shortcuts on toolbar are gone/back to defult items & I can't restore any of the past backedup sessions from the past week! I had at least 150+ tabs in 4 windows.

Retaining FF as default browser in Windoes 10 after PC restart,"I successfully make FF my default browser and it remains such for the current session. Session = one continuous login period.

Firefox 63 tab.close.button.transparent.background w/ hovered background,"Fx 63.0.3 in Linux.I added a tab close button (hovered) colored background. It's not necessarily same W x H as the inactive button transparent background - which is fine.I'd like to move the (inactive) 'X' close to the tab right end (did move it - not necessarily easiest way).The bottom of red background in hovered state needs to be close to the tab bottom & even with the tab's right end / side, for a better, easier target to close. I did that - more or less. :)The issue (that may have no solution) is the inactive button's transparent BG is 20x20px, I believe.So far, unless I make the hovered, colored background the same size as the inactive button's , it distorts the 'X' when the red background appears. So the button is semi-fixed? When hovered, it doesn't ""translate"" the X icon in the same HxW. Yes, people are starving in Africa & we're worried about pretty browsers.I assume because the inactive close button has different dimensions and margins than the added background does, the only way I can get the ""legs"" of the 'X' near the tab border is enter different margins for it than for the hovered, colored background? Question on the last part: *When you have a 20x20 button, originally positioned so the 'letter X' was ~ 5 - 7px from the border / end, what does Firefox ""do"" w/ the transparent part of the button, when you enter margins so the 'X' is very near the right tab border (right end of the moz-box or container)? Does it in effect, 'remove' part of the transparent button, as different margins are entered, to move the button closer & closer to the container's end?It appears the default close button's 'X' is 10px WxH. Since browser toolbox showed the button was 20x20px - I think, then it has a 5px margin? on all sides of the 'X' image.The main goals are: 1. Get more room for text on tabs. I also changed margins on the tab icons to move them near the tab left border & disabled tab text fadein. 2. Have a clickable background to close tabs - that lines up at the tab bottom, right corner & not have to ""fish around"" for the close button. I have that.So far, unless I make the hovered background the exact dimensions of the button, then use the exact margins on both, it will distort the X - depending on how different in size the inactive & hovered sizes are.I couldn't find a CSS property / feature that would allow *the original* X close button to shift up or left (undistorted), when the hovered background appears.Maybe the original close button could be hidden during hover and a new close button specified (adding a colored BG) with a new size? Say, 15x20 (or 30)? As long as the hovered BG is near the bottom, right corner. I think whatever space is occupied by the width of the transparent button edge (plus padding, if any), dictates how far the tab's text can extend to the right? Once hovered, I don't care if more or less text shows, since I'll be closing the tab, not reading it. If that's true, I could modify / create an overall smaller inactive close button - allowing more text on tabs. Or just ""remove"" the *inactive state* close button, & specify the same close button (plus red BG) for the hovered state.I'm not sure how hard it would be.It was kind of tedious, figuring out how much negative margin values to enter (for 2 different element sizes), so they both wound up (nearly) equidistant from the tab R end. Key word being ""nearly"". I didn't want the 'X' touching or almost - the tab divider line. But I want the hovered background touching it, to make an easier closing target. In blown up screenshot(sss), it seemed if I measured the distance between the close button visible 'X' and the tab's R border (say 7px), if I entered 5px, the visible 'X' moved, but NOT so it was 2px from the R border. It seemed something else was affecting it..tabbrowser-tab .tab-close-button { /* move inactive close button closer to tab R-end */ margin-top: 5px !important; margin-right: -10px !important; margin-left: 0px !important;}"

How can I play YouTube videos in 1080p 60fps without dropping frames?,"Ever since installing Firefox Quantum there have been times when YouTube videos couldn't play at 1080p 60fps without dropping frames, but it would always work itself out within a few days. These past few months however, the problem just won't go away. I can play videos at 1080p or at 720p 60fps, but 1080p 60fps seems to drop more frames than not. This is more of an issue for me now because I just recently improved my Internet enough to play videos at that resolution and not wait for them to buffer every few minutes.I'm using the latest version of Firefox (64.0). I tried disabling Hardware Acceleration, as was suggested, and I guess it's a bit better, but it's still dropping about 50% of the frames according to YouTube's ""stats for nerds."" Others have said to alter Firefox's configuration, but when I tried to, Firefox warned me not to proceed unless I knew what I was doing, which I really don't. Some have recommended installing various add-ons, but there's always someone claiming it doesn't help.I've tried using Google Chrome to watch the same videos, but it causes my CPU to spike so there's constant choppiness anyway. Microsoft Edge is the only browser I've used that seems to play these videos smoothly, but I'd rather not use it if I can help it. I've used Firefox for years now. I'm comfortable with it and it serves me well in most capacities.I've seen others ask about this, but all the answers either haven't worked for me or leave me confused. I'm not the most tech-savvy guy, so I'd appreciate it if someone could dumb it down just enough to walk me through it."

Cmd+Enter should work to complete URLs on Mac,"Last firefox update changed the URL canonization to Ctrl+Enter on all platforms.See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237027Why would you do this ??????Mac users are used to use the CMD key for every main operation is every single Mac application, including copy and paste (which turns to be even smarter in a terminal).This key has been create to improve the user experience in the first place, because it is very well located on the keyboard next to the space bar, the left thumb is almost always on top of it.If you really want to change this, then you have to change every other shortcut as well (Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+W, Cmd+Q, Cmd+T, ...) is order to be consistent.If you do not agree with this, please give us the opportunity to configure it.PS :I work on Linux and Windows all day long and use Ctrl+Enter to complete urls : it is fine!!I use a Mac at home to do everything and use CMD+Enter to complete urls : it is fine too!!

Something in Firefox is disabling a VFS connection in AWS Cloud9,"The Cloud9 IDE works well except for one function, preview a running application. This works in Chrome but not FF 64. Instead of the page loading correctly, it shows an AWS error page saying ""VFS connection does not exist"". The debugging output shows an exception code for NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI. It also appears to prepend a blob: protocol onto the http, something I didn't see in Chrome.I've tried allowing all cookies and disabling all extensions. I had also modified some params in about:config but I reset the ones I thought could have been interfering. Does anyone know what could be causing this? And is it FF-wide?"

Stripping AJAX data from the browser.,"Greetings,Is it possible to get data from a browser that was sent from a server that is directly connected to a Windows tablet in HotSpot mode? I purchased a BBQ temperature controller that sends temperature and alarm status to a browser via Wi-Fi. I want to trigger an audible event based on that data (which the unit does not do). I do not know how, or if it is even possible to extract that data from the browser. Would this be possible using Firefox?Thank you."

Issues creating search plugins using Mycroft Project plugins,"Some people mentioned using submitted search plugins from Mycroft Project as a template.Pick one for your search site (I was using Startpage.com).It should be easy. It was easy - before. This time it wasn't - but did eventually work (long, long time).In the screen, you see under Post Parameters. I was using https://startpage.com and changing a few options.They create a URL with those settings, but they're no longer in json format. That may be the problem.One result is in ""plain text"", but you'll see it's not json format. The other URL, the custom settings are obfuscated. I saw / tested other plugins for startpage from Mycroft that used the obfuscated string in BOTH the Post Parameters & Search Form URL entry & they seemed to worked fine. When I created mine & installed (them, about 5 diff times), it wouldn't start up with the color theme selected & saved in the string. The only way I got that to work was look at some other plugins on Mycroft & after the ""query={searchTerms}"" , I had to add ""&t=dark"", or else once installed, on the 1st use from the search manager, it opened the site w/ light theme. After another search, it recognized the dark theme chosen (& saved in the string their settings page created).Needless to say, there isn't any ""&t=dark"" setting in the strings that Startpage NOW creates. I used it because other plugins used it - even some recent ones w/ the ""new"" Startpage icon (2 blue rectangles w/ white stripe between). But there are no json strings being created by the site anymore for custom settings.I'm guessing that the open search form / specs like on Mycroft Project need json format data?Because the custom settings string also had 20 results per page & it only shows the default of 10. I'd guess the site ignores the settings in the plugin that don't use json? Maybe some of the older plugins using obfuscated strings were actually json to begin with? I don't see how the site could read (json) data if it's obfuscated.It appears their site still recognizes the names / values in json format, if you know the correct ones. I'd have to look in a lot of Startpage plugins to find the correct json format abbreviations for various settings, if that's the only way an open search plugin will work. Mozilla is making it hard for people not to use the included search engines - as is - for obvious reasons."

Is there a way to sync the Bookmarks Menu and the Bookmarks Toolbar?,"Is there a way to sync the Bookmarks Menu and the Bookmarks Toolbar? In Chrome, when I add a new bookmark, it is added to both in sync; this inconsistency (albeit maybe silly) is one of the reasons I haven't switched to Firefox full time. If I add a new bookmark to my Bookmarks Menu in Firefox, it does not add to the Toolbar and if I add a bookmark to the Toolbar, it shows up in the Menu within the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" folder instead of directly in the Menu.Thanks,Michael"
Problem with google search and recaptcha,"With Firefox (64.0.2) is impossible to use Google search, all I get is sorry page. If I use Edge or IE everything is ok. If I use Firefox and log on to my Google account, again is ok. Doe's Google deliberately block me or this is Firefox fault or block's me because I use Firefox? Found at forum that I sholud create dummy account... why?!?! I will switch to another browser (I am in computer user since 1990, also Firefox and Thunderbird user from first days).In my regular job Help Desk is similar to this, it is impossible to ask any question that differs from usual question, so things have to be like this, I think....I'm a little angry, writing letters instead of doing job, so sorry."
How do I remove an add-on which is not what I thought it would be?,I picked up a new TV remote today. It doesn't work properly. On the back of the remote it said if there are problems to contact ursupport.com. I went to the website and it said nothing about remotes. It only talked about robots! I had to make it an add-on in order to get support. I didn't get any support anyway since it was after hours. What have I done?!?! How do I remove whatever it is from my computer? Thanks!
"How can I restore my previous tabs if firefox crashed ? I found the file in my profile document but how to restore it, can you please write the steps ?","Hello dear, I had open my mozilla firefox browser (which I am using for a very long time with good experiences) and computer crushed and I had to turn it on again. Also I started again my mozilla browser but everything I had was gone and I could not take back history on usual way (restore previous session or windows ) and all my tabs 60 + were gone. However I researched a bit and I found data that firefox stores on my computer, and I found a file in folder named 'crashes' that probably contains my last session. Can you please help me to restore my session and can you write me the steps to do it, because informations in that session are life important for me. Thank you so much in advance."

How can I get the old Firefox (orange and blue) icon back on my Mac dock?,"I just updated my iMac to Mojave (biggest mistake of my life!). I also updated Firefox to its latest version as well. The orange and blue fire/fox around the blue sphere is gone and in its place is a piece of paper with pencils in an ""A"" shape.

Session restore showing no previous tabs,"Today I tried to restore a Firefox session after a crash and the Session Restore page came up with the restore session button greyed out and the list of tabs to restore is empty.There is also no option to restore the previous session in the settings drop-down menu.The next thing I did was check the Mozilla Support forums and found some helpful advice:https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1216918https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1224948Based on this advice I went to ""sessionstore-backups"" in \Users\your-user-name\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\and backed up the files I found there. I even used ShadowExplorer to find some earlier copies of said files and copied those as well.So -with Firefox closed- I copied an older recovery.jsonlz4 and replaced the new one with it.Sadly, when I then open Firefox, the same thing happens. Recovery page with no option to recover, 0 tabs present.Am I doing something wrong?P.S. I should add that I simply DO NOT HAVE a restore session option in my drop-down menu. See attached images.P.P.S. No longer having the option to get the ""ask to save and quit"" notification when exiting the browser is a travesty. That option should be brought back ASAP. Both for the extra warning before quitting, and to give you the ability to choose whether or not to discard certain tabs."
Sync is disconnected after a cold computer start.,"One of my computers lost every time when i start the browser the connection with Sync. The only why to solve is, delete account and sign in. When i directy sign in, my passwords didn't come back. Sync is disconnected after a cold computer start."
Copy link location - disable copied links from including http://hiderefer.com/?,"I am using FF 64.0.2 in Win 10.Recently I have noticed that when I right click on a link and choose ""Copy link location"" then go to paste the link the resulting link includes ""http://hiderefer.com/?"" at the beginning of the address that I copied. I do not care to have the hidereferer included in the pasted copy. Can this be stopped?"
Recently updated to firefox Quantum 64 and now my tabs are so small I can't read enough of the title to know what they are.,"I have a couple hundred tabs opened, but in my previous version (FF28 which I loved) I could read enough of the tab titles (web page titles) to tell what they were and therefore could switch easily to every tab. Now, I can't read enough of the title to know what they are. I can see an icon then about 3 letters. This is extremely frustrating! If I can't get a solution to this I will probably have to switch to another browser that will allow this, leaving FF behind for good . I have too much work that depends on my ability to switch to various tabs, so I really hope I can get some help here. Another related issue I am having with FF 64 is the inability to reopen the most recently closed tab by right clicking the tab bar, selecting reopen closed tab. I know I can go to History > recently closed tabs, but this makes it more time consuming. I can not for the life of me understand why this changed was made. Maybe something in my profile preferences was corrupted somehow? I just want to be able to quickly reopen my last closed tab like before without having to go to the freakin' menu or use an add-on.Thanks in advance for your help!edited to correct 67 to 64"

Scrolling with apple track pad scrolls left and right also when scrolling normally...,"So when scrolling normally with my mac track pad the body of the web page moves fully to the left or right as I scroll on any web page.

CSS3 Animations are not visible on my Firefox browsers but are on other browsers and other user's FF.,"I manage the Wordpress site: https://www.visionarycomics.com/On the main page there is a news ticker at the top of the page with BREAKING NEWS as a header, then a rotating link to different features that should scroll. Likewise, after the initial section is a section entitled VISIONARY BLOGS that has a blog feature slider, with newer posts showing and the ability to scroll back to older posts (there is only one at the current time).Both the scrolling news ticker and the blog slider use CSS3 animation. They both show up fine on my Chrome browsers on both my laptop and netbook, but neither is visible on my Firefox browser on either computer. Other people have told me they can view both features just fine on their Firefox browsers, but no matter what I do I cannot get them to show on mine.I'm assuming this is some setting in my browsers, but I never customized them, so, I'm concerned how widespread the lack of visibility may be as I find it hard to beleive mine would be the only one.My web designer hasn't been able to figure it out either. Hoping someone can help me out here."
