Why does Open in a New Window sometimes us the letter 'N' and sometimes 'W'?,When using a right click menu with a mouse it would be helpful to always us 'W' for window and 'T' for tab. Besides being easy to remember they are both on the right side of the keyboard and you can keep your hand on the mouse.

Firefox hangs / high CPU use when trying to open a local file,"I mean, that's it. If I try, through any means* to open a local HTML file or folder, that tab churns forever, spins up high CPU use, unresponsive to any form of interaction, and has to be killed using task manager. Means tried include: - in FF: File, Open, select an HTML file. - in FF: use ""file://c:/"" - from Windows Explorer: context menu, ""open with"" -> Firefox - from Windows Explorer: drag HTML file to Firefox address barWindows 10 64-bit (does Win10 even have 32-bit?), FF 62.0 64-bit, middling late-model Dell laptop (16GB memory, i5-7300U, Intel graphics)."

"How to stop the many many outbound connections beyond those addressed in the ""How to stop Firefox from making automatic connections"" page?","I just installed a PortableApps version of firefox 52.9.0 (32 bit) ESR. On startup it tries to make numerous outbound connections. They are mostly to Mozilla IP addresses I think. Some of the IP addresses are LIKE these (these plus slight variations on these):54.191.46.2854.187.147.16735.166.127.14852.34.90.2335.166.127.148I have no add-ons or extensions installed.I have set up privacy as much as I could to prevent outbound connections.I have gone through Mozilla's webpage ""How to stop Firefox from making automatic connections"" and done all of that stuff.So I would like to prevent all these unwanted outbound connections.I am also curious what would be contained in all these packets that ff is sending to these addresses.Thanks!"
Something starts happening after two hours or so on Firefox - WHAT IS IT?,"For over a year now, I have experienced the 'phenomenon' that after between two and three hours of browsing, the whole of Firefox just grinds to a halt. I have tried all the various suggestions but nothing works.I have a large number of tabs, because they are all regularly used in my family history research, I am moving between web sites all the time to gain information, capture screen shots from Trove, and update data on Ancestry and MyHeritage, particularly, I am also switching to other programs regularly, e.g. Photoshop Elements, Excel and Word.As a retired programmer, and amateur web site developer, I am wondering whether the browser is doing some activity such as indexing across all tabs, or refreshing of all tabs, after two hours - if so I am seeking some way to disable this activity, which I don't want to happen, because it is just annoying and wasting precious time in a life timetable which is rapidly coming near to its end.Along similar lines of frustration I am also experiencing that if I leave the browser open and go away to have a meal (for maybe 1 to 2 hours or even sometimes as little as 10 to 15 minutes) it is nearly never possible to get Firefox to just start up again when I go to access a tab in the session that I left open. Very often Firefox crashes in such situations, while on other occasions it just takes maybe as much as half an hour for it to get back up to pace, so to say. Again - Is Firefox doing some background tasks? I do not want Firefox to do any background tasks of ANY KIND. I simply want a browser that shows me the page when I request it and then leaves it alone, no automatic refreshing, no indexing, no nothing - simple page display. I only want refreshing when I ask for it.Finally, this last point is maybe Firefox related, maybe Ancestry related, maybe OS related, I am not sure, but again it is something to do with Firefox not doing the basics, but seemingly doing lots of other things that I do not want it to do. Often when I add information to a record that is open on a tab in Ancestry, the re-display of the tab, with the updated information, does not come back up with its proper name, e.g. ""Philip Mark Hunt"", instead it just comes up as ""Ancestry Person"". It is as though the reloading of the tab has hit some kind of timeout, so it just defaults to a general name rather than the true tab name."

reset password on university website that uses windows authentication,"I attend University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, UAFS. Every few months they require students to change their passwords, this is fine on campus, but at home when it changes I have to retype the username and password every time I want to log in and there is no one else here to compromise my computer. I had to recently reload my computer after it crashed, the first time I had to fill it in was fine and since reloading the OS it remembers the information, but when I have to change my password , I have until Oct 2nd, and the authentication window appears and I change what is in it to log in, then the next time after that I will have to retype the info everytime I log in. This will happen until I either have to reload windows or get a new computer. My question: is there a way to reset this so that I don't have to retype it ever single time after I have to change it. I didn't know where to start asking this and I realize you may not be the ones to ask but I was hoping you could give me some insight. Thank you!"

turn off update message after firefox 62,"As of about firefox 63, it will no longer be possible to prevent firefox from checking for updates as the preference (option) to do so is being removed.

In such organizations, the latest firefox would be obtained once, checked out, then rolled out to the organization from it's support system team/person. Is there going to be a way to prevent the message ""an update is available, please install?"""

how to disable autoupdate of firefox 52>60esr? its important! I don't care why you stop supporting 52esr - it's the only one browser that allows me work,"Governments and their agencies are in no hurry to update their websites and web applications. 52 esr is the only one version of your browser that works with such ""hurdles"". To suggest the transition in IE and Edge is not necessary, they are not working with some sites. Where they can be used - and we do. The situation is very unpleasant we have to use 4 different browsers for different tasks and your demarche deprives us of one of the most important. To expect governments best response to changes of the surrounding world is naive. Please ask users to update or not their version of firefox. Thanks. Yet we must smash 60 esr and reinstall 52 esr daily."

"When sites ask me to ""agree"" to cookies, how do I ""disagree""?","In recent years, I keep seeing prompts at the top of the page telling me I need to ""agree"" to cookies.First of all - what are these prompts called and why have they started appearing so commonly?But I was mostly wondering - how do I DISAGREE with cookies? There's never a disagree button.And is there any real point to agreeing (or disagreeing), since not all sites even bother to ask, so I presume they don't need your permission to use cookies?"
Changing the Input Language to Japanese freezes Firefox,"When I change to Japanese input, Firefox ""stops responding"" for a few seconds. This is consistent.I change my inputs from ENG to Chinese to Japanese and back to English, but the freeze only happens when switching to Japanese.

Selecting Mandarin does not manifest this problem.When I restart Firefox, the problem goes away for a while before it comes back."
Notes missing from bookmarks in new version of Firefox,"It looks like i'm not the only one upset with the newest update. Will the problem with the hidden data be fixed?From what i have been able to learn, the information we had stored in the ""Properties"" tab is still in the Mozilla system but now hidden. I'm guessing the Key word box is its replacement, but i cant get to the hidden tab to make the transfer. How about giving us the option to transfer from Properties to Key Word?I found the Properties tab very useful for my website information and am feeling very much at a loss.I would sure appreciate an answer or a tip that solves the problem.Ive never done this before so dont know where i will find the response, so guidance on that will be appreciated as well."

Is there a way to setup a keyword shortcut when creating a bookmark?,"This is something that has been driving me crazy in Firefox for a long time and I don't understand why this isn't a standard feature. One of my favorite features is the ability to create custom bookmark keywords for my bookmarks. This is normally done by opening your bookmarks, right click --> properties and there you have the option. This is very cumbersome and my wish is to be able to set these keywords right when I'm first creating the bookmark. There used to be an old extension that allowed this functionality. There also was a way to do it by modifying userChrome.css see here: https://lifehacker.com/5738698/add-bookmark-keywords-to-firefox-from-the-address-barNow when I try this userChrome.css method it doesn't seem to be working for me. I can see the keyword field when creating a bookmark, but it's not saving my changes. I really wish this was a core feature and not something I have to hack into firefox everytime I start a fresh install. Bookmark keywords is a great feature, and I don't understand why the devs make it so inconvenient to use."

Problems with beta outlook email and Moziila -- Still Happening with Other Users,"I am repeating the issue that was stated then 'closed' a few days ago, even though there are at least 2 of us 'out there' who are still experiencing the exact same problem: I use Outlook email, and they changed me over to beta. Ever since, when I try to scroll down and check my email list, the screen keeps bouncing up to the top emails. It's impossible to scroll down to the lower ones. (They took away the option to switch out of beta.)Not only am I having the exact same problem, which started at the exact same time as the original note -- in September 2018, when Outlook 'permanently' changed service to what had previously been optional 'beta' -- I have now also stepped through each Mozilla troubleshooting step (1 thru 6+) & it has not resolved the frustrating behavior. I opened a case and have completed troubleshooting with Microsoft; they've pointed me to the ""3rd party browser"" for further troubleshooting.I am having no trouble whatsoever with Chrome, IE, or the Outlook Android app. It is ONLY happening (as described at the outset) when using Hotmail, transitioned from the beta with no way of returning to classic, when attempting to view my email account via the Mozilla browser.I sure hope you're able to dig into this further on your side: I would really prefer to use Firefox than another browser.Thank you!"

FF excessive memory usage,"I been noticing lately alot of posting of FF excessive RAM usage or Taxing on the system Resources. My best guess here is that FF during the Auto updates has become corrupted from either the update or some other software causing the update error thus leading to excessive RAM usage causing system freezing or unresponsive Browser or making the computer in General slow and unresponsive.Below is what one should really do in order to eliminate if the Browser is the culprit to the problem.1. Download the latest version of FF based on your O/S version 32bit to 32bit Browser or 64bit O/S to 64bit Browserhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/2. Backup your BookMark if you have one created or any CSS style you added as well3. Write down any Addons/Extensions so you can find and download them later4. Uninstall all FF installs and Deleted the Mozilla folder5. Restart6. Reinstall the new FF and then update with the Addons/Extensions7. Restore your BookMark back.8. Run FF to see if the problem returns or notNow if you do all this and still have problems then it's not a FF issue but something related to either adblockers, A/V being to aggressive or Malware/Virus is present and blocking any Browser from working correctly. And this point would require a Computer shop to resolve the problem."

Since I Reset Firefox no new passwords are saved,I Reset Firefox because it was slow and I was getting many 'not responding' freeze ups. It worked and my system is much faster now. I reinstalled adblocker and send to mail and changed the theme back to light from the default.I also changed the security setting to Save Logins. Today I find that all my saved logins are no longer there but I put that down to the Reset and decided it was probably time I set up new passwords. I have entered password reset a couple of sites and said yes to save the login when the pop up window appears. When I returned to the sites later to login it had not remembered the logins. When I check the Saved Logins there is nothing saved.Have I missed a setting or is there a problem.

Found an attack site. Thought of way to prevent successful attack. (Feature Suggestion),"I went to the site at this link (DO NOT CLICK!!!):http:// 134.249.116.78 /index.php The URL Google said the link would lead to is this: www. javcolor .com/ytvvo4l/npeeo6is.php?dtjfygku=embed...It tried to brute force open dialogs to get me to download something and kept popping up all sorts of crap. It prevented me from closing the tab by opening up endless dialogs. I finally was able to close the tab by pressing ESC rapidly. So my suggestion is to allow closing the current tab even if a dialog has focus in the application. This would not allow a website to pop up save dialogs and other dialogs preventing you from closing the tab. Honestly with the current architecture of applications I am not sure this is possible if the dialog is modal. So I guess is there any kind of emergency mechanism to prevent this kind of thing already? I have pop ups blocked in Firefox settings. I just have never seen a someone abuse the save file dialog like this.Perhaps I need some third party plugin to protect myself from this. I used to run Noscript, but ran into issues with usability of websites. I also got weary of having to enable servers all the time."

Firefox takes a long time until it starts with loading a new page,"Hello,since the last update (v63.0, Windows) I have an issue that makes Firefox not usable. I hope you can help me.Every time I open a new webpage, over a hyperlink or manually, Firefox takes 5-8 seconds until it starts to load the page. It seems like Firefox does nearly nothing at this point, there is no traffic going out, no CPU usage etc. There is also no status message in the bottom left corner like ""Waiting for https://foobar.com..."". After 5-8 seconds Firefox starts to load the page and then it goes very fast.This makes it impossible to use Firefox, because normal activities take a lot of time, because every click takes 5-8 seconds. On chrome on the same PC everything is OK.I already did nearly everything to reset and clear my Firefox installation, I reinstalled and deleted the Mozilla folder in the AppData directory, the problem still persists. My colleague has the same issue since this update, so it's not only my PC.I hope you can help me."

It just started closing upon minimization this morning. How do I get it back to how it was? I will have to use a different browser if there is no fix for this and I really don't want to do that.I should also add that Firefox had been pinned to my taskbar. This morning it was gone and I had to re-pin it there. But it doesn't matter whether I open it from the taskbar or from the menu, it shuts down when I minimize. Please help!I also just noticed that even if I don't minimize it, if I do anything else on my computer it closes and I have to completely restart it. I absolutely can't work this way. For example, if I leave it open and then open my Word document, when I try to go back to Firefox it has closed and has to re-start. All the information I just researched is gone. I'm very, very frustrated."
Cannot copy multiple links from Media tab of the Page Info window on OS X,"If I open the Page Info window and go to the Media tab I can see many links for the assets of a given page, and I can select multiple items. However, I cannot copy these items to clipboard as the ""copy"" option is greyed out on the context menu as well as the main navbar dropdown. The respective keyboard shortcut ⌘C is also disabled and does nothing. I *can* copy a single link at a time - copy function only stops working when multiple items are selected. I'd simply like to copy that list of links to a text editor. How can this be done and why am not not able to copy these links?Based on my earlier question (which went unanswered and is now archived / https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1209191 ) I have concluded that this is OS X specific and have since tested on Windows and Ubuntu which are both able to copy multiple links without any problem.I've also filed a bug report here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452537 which has had zero activity or response.

Do I need to clear existing cookies to remove the myriad of sites already tracking me before turning on tracking protection? Or, will turning it on do an immediate filter on my existing cookies? 2. Will turning off tracking stop sites that I want to retain login information for from retaining the ""login"" cookie infor i.e. are we close to a full ""cookie block"" with anti-tracking? Or does FFox have some creative algorithm (or list) that allows it to distinguish between tracking cookies and less offensive cookies? Concurrently, is there a way to allow a ""tracking cookie"" if I need it to retain information for a site I'm comfortable with?3. One specific tracking question: Will eliminating tracking cookies stop (specifically) Google's cross site advertising, where you look at a product on site A (who shares that info via google) and then a little later google's advertising mechanism pops up those products when you're at site B?"

If it helps, most recently it happened on Visa Checkout pop-up for Ticketmaster. I didn't want to repeat the process in Edge as I would lose my tickets so instead I opted to reset password. I tried my old password and lo and behold, it said I cannot use my current password. Then... why didn't you let me in?

Will Saved Password Editor ever work again?,"The Saved Password Editor (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saved-password-editor/) was an excellent extension and highly useful extension, rendered inoperative by Quantum. While some people may think that this extension is no longer needed because of the built-in editor (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1186297) this is incorrect for a number of reasons: Some website don't capture the login information and there is no way to manually enter the information: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1234322. Editing some json file is a ridiculous suggestion. It annoying to navigate to the built-in editor and recently FF moved the ""saved logins..."" button down about:preferences#privacy so you now have to scroll in addition to clicking. Note: bookmarking chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul is handy, but doesn't solve the other problems. The built-in editor does not allow editing the website URL or duplicating a login. All of this make it impossible to use the built-in password editor to save things like PINs or answers to secret questions, all of which was very easy with the Saved Password Editor extension.So will Firefox ever enable the Saved Password Editor to work again? The add-on page says that the extension needs a WebExtensions API. Will Firefox ever have one of those again? If the functionality was added into the build-in password manager, that would be good, too. Thank you."

"MacBook 2.2 GHz Core Duo with 4GB 667 MHz DDR2 DRAM running version 10.7.5 no longer supports Firefox, any suggestions that would allow me to update Firefox?",My question describes the problem.

Firefox now has ad blocker and it causes issues with sites I visit. I don't know how to modify it; I am not using in private browsing. It's on all the time.,"I no longer see ads when I read email, look at a magazine or newspaper article etc. Some sites don't like this and won't let me view what's on them because I am blocking ads. I have looked at Options>Privacy and Security>Tracking Protection and it is not turned on. It is only on when I use a privacy window which I am not using. I have no idea where to look to be able to modify this. I have cookies enabled.I will admit I have far fewer crashes now that the ads do not display in email and I am happy about that but when a site I belong to won't let me read there because ads are blocked that becomes a problem. Do I have any control over this feature? I only use Firefox on my pc that runs Win 7 Professional and I use version 60.3 esr 32 bit because I still run into situations where Java is required and it was explained in an earlier question that I should use Firefox esr because of this."
black screen of death (ksod),"I have a new Dell Inspiron 7373 released in October 2017 with 8th generation i7 and Intel 620 graphics...This is a new problem from sometime around (before?) the release of Quantum...

I have tried disabling hardware acceleration and uninstalling/reinstalling the Intel graphics driver (which is not testable for long since Windows Update re-installs it almost immediately, though I could try disabling wuauserv in the services manager...)I also reinstalled Firefox and refreshed my profile, and tried running the browser in with the add-ons disabled......Please adviseThank you for your time and consideration"

SSL website not able to open on 63.0.3 version of Firefox,"Dear Community Members,We are facing issue opening our website in 63.0.3.

"When on www.nytimes.com, Firefox pop-up stating ""This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved."" appears.","Starting this morning, whenever I click on a link on www.nytimes.com, a pop-up appears that says ""This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved."" and requires that I either click ""Stay on Page"" or ""Leave Page"". I have never seen this before and it only seems to happen on www.nytimes.com. Has anyone else had this issue? If so, how can I make it go away? Is there something that may have changed in Firefox Preferences with the most recent update? See attached screen shot."
Sound in videos continually goes out. There's also several warning signs of padlock w/exclamation mark. How can i change that even if risky sites Per FF,"Hello, I think my problem is when i pull up some videos. Now on the site itself for instance, one video plays fine while another doesn't. It's trusting site and it's probably videos that are recorded different equipment as the host will interview different people. So, then the exclamation in the padlock appears and then no sound. One time i unmuted all the sound mixer's icons at the bottom but still couldn't get the sound. I just ""refreshed"" the FF so it should be fine. I am trying to see how to manipulate the settings to lose the exclaimation mark on the padlock when i trust the site so as to, of course, avoid this setting whenever i just start to find interest in video and then bam-no sound. Thanks if you can provide any solutions to try.Keith Leisure"

"when ever I run Firefox.exe I get an error of ""The data is invalid"" but if I rename firefox.exe to firefox1.exe it runs with no problems.","Ever since Firefox nightly did an update a few days ago, I have been unable to run it from the normal shortcut. I had to make a copy of the exe and rename it and only then would it work from the renamed file. If I click a link in Thunderbird, for example it still looks for Firefox.exe and not the renamed file. If I change the tile to Firefox.exe.bak so that only Firefox1.exe is accessible, I still have to run it manually from that new file name rather than the default. This is a new install of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate and this is the only time I have ever had problems with nightly. Now, when I restart the browser, it downloads a new firefox.exe and the error returns. I would rather try and fix the problem than remove all traces of it then reinstall, that would be like ignoring the problem and starting over which won't 'fix' the error that others might have."

"Firefox 63 - tabs crash VERY frequently on websites requiring computation (e.g., Google Doc/Drive) in Ubuntu 18.04","Hey everyone, My tabs keep consistently crashing on specific websites, it's hard for me to describe since I'm not an expert, but it's pages where there's some sort of heavier processing going on - like running Google Docs or sometimes just doing like a Captcha or uploading documents. Gmail also crashes VERY frequently. I've been putting up with it for a while since tabs usually reload quickly, but I'd love to get this figured out since I'm increasingly relying on Google Drive for work.Important to note that I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 which is otherwise completely stable. Firefox is also the most stable web browser available for me. I have tried several solutions that have worked for other people:-I tried setting browser.tabs.remote.autostart to FALSE and that actually led to the entire firefox program crashing instead of tabs! Weird. And worse, so I set it back to TRUE. -I updated my graphics drivers, I have an Intel® HD Graphics 520 (Skylake GT2) graphics card, I updated using this link https://launchpad.net/~paulo-miguel-dias/+archive/ubuntu/pkppa/, which seemed to help only momentarily.-I have disabled hardware acceleration. This actually made no difference at all. -I have disabled WebGL but it didn't make much of a difference. webgl.disabled is currently set to FALSE since it didn't help. My computer has had some larger mysterious problems that forced me to switch to Ubuntu from Windows, I suspect it has something to do with my GPU but I don't really know. Anyway if someone has suggestions on how I can be more specific with describing the problem, please let me know. Thank you for your time!"

Bring back Bookmark Descriptions lost in 62.0,"There have been large discussions about Bookmark Descriptions. There are some awkward workarounds but Bookmarks are essentially a hierarchical data base with Notes/Description capability. Web site logons are getting very, very complex with many keywords and alternate authentications. The description field was the best way to remember and store all of these keywords and unique ways to search that particular web page. It worked extremely well before it was removed. In what release will the Bookmark Description field be reinstated?"

"add-on search results listing should show permissions per result, without having to check each separately, please.","Many people avoid add-ons that require certain permissions, more often if there is no public source. It would be advantageous to the user to be able to more conveniently avoid add-ons that do not require permissions they deem inappropriate.If the permission list was given, per add-on, in the add-on search results list, the user would be able to find the self-appropriate add-ons without having to look through them all. (e.g. 58 results for youtube adblock"")This would help promote those who create add-ons that are intentionally less intrusive, which is 100% fair and a good thing.Another step could be to indicate, in the search results, whether source is open publicly available. That goes a long way toward creating trust and fostering business and success.This would help promote those who create add-ons that are more open. Another individual's request was to filter the add-on search results by user-selected permissions. That would be great. Might be more work and for a later version but for now I think this request is not too hard (said every hardware engineer ever).Thanks!"

Firefox crashes,"ID: a2c13d00-c35a-41b9-add1-45c2a0181206Every time I try to upload a file to WordPress, Firefox crashes when the pop up window opens to browse my files. Besides the fact that this problem never happened before this week, the odd thing was, on one attempt, I tried to locate a file - and though Firefox crashed yet again- it crashed AFTER I selected the file and actually uploaded it. Every attempt before and after it crashed before I could even select a file. And it didn't crash when I tried to upload an image here! But I also notice the file isn't appearing in the uploaded images window below, the upload icon is circling in ""the endless loop of death"". Could it be that WordPress did something to their program because they are about to launch what they're calling an ""upgrade""? or did microsuck issue another ""upgrade"" during last weekend and wreck everything again?"

Firefox tab hangs,"A while back I started having problems with tabs hanging in Firefox. This happens arbitrarily, in any site, without any user input. It may happen with tabs that have been on the background for a long while or with a brand new tab that I just opened. I'm attaching screenshots for a tab (that was) showing Facebook and one for a new tab without any site loaded. Whenever this happens, there will be a ""WebContent"" process at 100% CPU. The only solution is for me to kill that process.I'm seeing this in two different computers, work and home. The usage pattern between these two is quite different, although I do have Firefox sync in both of them. I've tried deleting my profile (rm -rf ~/.mozilla/) but that hasn't helped. I've tried using safe mode and couldn't reproduce the error, but since these crashes happen about twice a day it's hard to say for sure.

Make firefox based browser,"Since from what I know firefox is open-source, how do I make a firefox based browser?"
Firefox default browser preference does not stick,"I'm running FF 63.0.3 on Win10x64. For a long time, I kept Firefox to set my default browser to Firefox in the Options menu. Lately, every time I open FF, I am advised that FF is not my default browser. Then, I set it to the default in Windows/Settings/Apps. But after I close FF and reopen it, I'm again prompted that FF is not the default browser. So I go through the process yet again.Could there be some Windows registry setting? I created second profile and copied the bookmarks, cert8/9 files over from the original profile, and I installed the same extensions. However, the issue occurs in my new profile as well. Thanks for any suggestions."

Firefox 63 tab.close.button.transparent.background w/ hovered background,"Fx 63.0.3 in Linux.I added a tab close button (hovered) colored background. It's not necessarily same W x H as the inactive button transparent background - which is fine.I'd like to move the (inactive) 'X' close to the tab right end (did move it - not necessarily easiest way).The bottom of red background in hovered state needs to be close to the tab bottom & even with the tab's right end / side, for a better, easier target to close. I did that - more or less. :)The issue (that may have no solution) is the inactive button's transparent BG is 20x20px, I believe.So far, unless I make the hovered, colored background the same size as the inactive button's , it distorts the 'X' when the red background appears. So the button is semi-fixed? When hovered, it doesn't ""translate"" the X icon in the same HxW. Yes, people are starving in Africa & we're worried about pretty browsers.I assume because the inactive close button has different dimensions and margins than the added background does, the only way I can get the ""legs"" of the 'X' near the tab border is enter different margins for it than for the hovered, colored background? Question on the last part: *When you have a 20x20 button, originally positioned so the 'letter X' was ~ 5 - 7px from the border / end, what does Firefox ""do"" w/ the transparent part of the button, when you enter margins so the 'X' is very near the right tab border (right end of the moz-box or container)? Does it in effect, 'remove' part of the transparent button, as different margins are entered, to move the button closer & closer to the container's end?It appears the default close button's 'X' is 10px WxH. Since browser toolbox showed the button was 20x20px - I think, then it has a 5px margin? on all sides of the 'X' image.The main goals are: 1. Get more room for text on tabs. I also changed margins on the tab icons to move them near the tab left border & disabled tab text fadein. 2. Have a clickable background to close tabs - that lines up at the tab bottom, right corner & not have to ""fish around"" for the close button. I have that.So far, unless I make the hovered background the exact dimensions of the button, then use the exact margins on both, it will distort the X - depending on how different in size the inactive & hovered sizes are.I couldn't find a CSS property / feature that would allow *the original* X close button to shift up or left (undistorted), when the hovered background appears.Maybe the original close button could be hidden during hover and a new close button specified (adding a colored BG) with a new size? Say, 15x20 (or 30)? As long as the hovered BG is near the bottom, right corner. I think whatever space is occupied by the width of the transparent button edge (plus padding, if any), dictates how far the tab's text can extend to the right? Once hovered, I don't care if more or less text shows, since I'll be closing the tab, not reading it. If that's true, I could modify / create an overall smaller inactive close button - allowing more text on tabs. Or just ""remove"" the *inactive state* close button, & specify the same close button (plus red BG) for the hovered state.I'm not sure how hard it would be.It was kind of tedious, figuring out how much negative margin values to enter (for 2 different element sizes), so they both wound up (nearly) equidistant from the tab R end. Key word being ""nearly"". I didn't want the 'X' touching or almost - the tab divider line. But I want the hovered background touching it, to make an easier closing target. In blown up screenshot(sss), it seemed if I measured the distance between the close button visible 'X' and the tab's R border (say 7px), if I entered 5px, the visible 'X' moved, but NOT so it was 2px from the R border. It seemed something else was affecting it..tabbrowser-tab .tab-close-button { /* move inactive close button closer to tab R-end */ margin-top: 5px !important; margin-right: -10px !important; margin-left: 0px !important;}"

How can I play YouTube videos in 1080p 60fps without dropping frames?,"Ever since installing Firefox Quantum there have been times when YouTube videos couldn't play at 1080p 60fps without dropping frames, but it would always work itself out within a few days. These past few months however, the problem just won't go away. I can play videos at 1080p or at 720p 60fps, but 1080p 60fps seems to drop more frames than not. This is more of an issue for me now because I just recently improved my Internet enough to play videos at that resolution and not wait for them to buffer every few minutes.I'm using the latest version of Firefox (64.0). I tried disabling Hardware Acceleration, as was suggested, and I guess it's a bit better, but it's still dropping about 50% of the frames according to YouTube's ""stats for nerds."" Others have said to alter Firefox's configuration, but when I tried to, Firefox warned me not to proceed unless I knew what I was doing, which I really don't. Some have recommended installing various add-ons, but there's always someone claiming it doesn't help.I've tried using Google Chrome to watch the same videos, but it causes my CPU to spike so there's constant choppiness anyway. Microsoft Edge is the only browser I've used that seems to play these videos smoothly, but I'd rather not use it if I can help it. I've used Firefox for years now. I'm comfortable with it and it serves me well in most capacities.I've seen others ask about this, but all the answers either haven't worked for me or leave me confused. I'm not the most tech-savvy guy, so I'd appreciate it if someone could dumb it down just enough to walk me through it."

Cmd+Enter should work to complete URLs on Mac,"Last firefox update changed the URL canonization to Ctrl+Enter on all platforms.See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237027Why would you do this ??????Mac users are used to use the CMD key for every main operation is every single Mac application, including copy and paste (which turns to be even smarter in a terminal).This key has been create to improve the user experience in the first place, because it is very well located on the keyboard next to the space bar, the left thumb is almost always on top of it.If you really want to change this, then you have to change every other shortcut as well (Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+W, Cmd+Q, Cmd+T, ...) is order to be consistent.If you do not agree with this, please give us the opportunity to configure it.PS :I work on Linux and Windows all day long and use Ctrl+Enter to complete urls : it is fine!!I use a Mac at home to do everything and use CMD+Enter to complete urls : it is fine too!!

Something in Firefox is disabling a VFS connection in AWS Cloud9,"The Cloud9 IDE works well except for one function, preview a running application. This works in Chrome but not FF 64.

Stripping AJAX data from the browser.,"Greetings,Is it possible to get data from a browser that was sent from a server that is directly connected to a Windows tablet in HotSpot mode?

Issues creating search plugins using Mycroft Project plugins,"Some people mentioned using submitted search plugins from Mycroft Project as a template.Pick one for your search site (I was using Startpage.com).It should be easy. It was easy - before. This time it wasn't - but did eventually work (long, long time).In the screen, you see under Post Parameters. I was using https://startpage.com and changing a few options.They create a URL with those settings, but they're no longer in json format. That may be the problem.One result is in ""plain text"", but you'll see it's not json format. The other URL, the custom settings are obfuscated. I saw / tested other plugins for startpage from Mycroft that used the obfuscated string in BOTH the Post Parameters & Search Form URL entry & they seemed to worked fine. When I created mine & installed (them, about 5 diff times), it wouldn't start up with the color theme selected & saved in the string. The only way I got that to work was look at some other plugins on Mycroft & after the ""query={searchTerms}"" , I had to add ""&t=dark"", or else once installed, on the 1st use from the search manager, it opened the site w/ light theme. After another search, it recognized the dark theme chosen (& saved in the string their settings page created).Needless to say, there isn't any ""&t=dark"" setting in the strings that Startpage NOW creates. I used it because other plugins used it - even some recent ones w/ the ""new"" Startpage icon (2 blue rectangles w/ white stripe between). But there are no json strings being created by the site anymore for custom settings.I'm guessing that the open search form / specs like on Mycroft Project need json format data?Because the custom settings string also had 20 results per page & it only shows the default of 10. I'd guess the site ignores the settings in the plugin that don't use json? Maybe some of the older plugins using obfuscated strings were actually json to begin with? I don't see how the site could read (json) data if it's obfuscated.It appears their site still recognizes the names / values in json format, if you know the correct ones. I'd have to look in a lot of Startpage plugins to find the correct json format abbreviations for various settings, if that's the only way an open search plugin will work. Mozilla is making it hard for people not to use the included search engines - as is - for obvious reasons."

How do I remove an add-on which is not what I thought it would be?,I picked up a new TV remote today. It doesn't work properly.

Session restore showing no previous tabs,"Today I tried to restore a Firefox session after a crash and the Session Restore page came up with the restore session button greyed out and the list of tabs to restore is empty.There is also no option to restore the previous session in the settings drop-down menu.The next thing I did was check the Mozilla Support forums and found some helpful advice:https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1204253https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1216918https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1224948Based on this advice I went to ""sessionstore-backups"" in \Users\your-user-name\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\and backed up the files I found there. I even used ShadowExplorer to find some earlier copies of said files and copied those as well.So -with Firefox closed- I copied an older recovery.jsonlz4 and replaced the new one with it.Sadly, when I then open Firefox, the same thing happens. Recovery page with no option to recover, 0 tabs present.Am I doing something wrong?P.S. I should add that I simply DO NOT HAVE a restore session option in my drop-down menu. See attached images.P.P.S. No longer having the option to get the ""ask to save and quit"" notification when exiting the browser is a travesty. That option should be brought back ASAP. Both for the extra warning before quitting, and to give you the ability to choose whether or not to discard certain tabs."

Recently updated to firefox Quantum 64 and now my tabs are so small I can't read enough of the title to know what they are.,"I have a couple hundred tabs opened, but in my previous version (FF28 which I loved) I could read enough of the tab titles (web page titles) to tell what they were and therefore could switch easily to every tab. Now, I can't read enough of the title to know what they are. I can see an icon then about 3 letters. This is extremely frustrating! If I can't get a solution to this I will probably have to switch to another browser that will allow this, leaving FF behind for good . I have too much work that depends on my ability to switch to various tabs, so I really hope I can get some help here. Another related issue I am having with FF 64 is the inability to reopen the most recently closed tab by right clicking the tab bar, selecting reopen closed tab. I know I can go to History > recently closed tabs, but this makes it more time consuming. I can not for the life of me understand why this changed was made. Maybe something in my profile preferences was corrupted somehow? I just want to be able to quickly reopen my last closed tab like before without having to go to the freakin' menu or use an add-on.Thanks in advance for your help!edited to correct 67 to 64"

How do I disable autoplay of media in 66.0b2 (64-bit) Developer Edition?,"I've always loved Firefox but I've ran into a wall with 66.0b2 (64-bit) Developer Edition where autoplay of media is concerned. What I've noticed--and this just recently started doing this as I think something was updated yesterday--is that if someone posts a YouTube video on a Facebook status feed, the video will play on its own despite my having the following media settings configured in about:config:media.autoplay.default;1media.autoplay.enabled.user-gestures-needed;falseI've noticed that when I set media.autoplay.allow-muted to false, the autoplay finally stops and I'd be okay with this were it not for the volume being unmuted when I click on the play button.So, is there any way to make it that I have to press the play button but when it plays, the sound is muted?"
"The bookmark feature fails to work. Aside from accessing existing bookmarks, I can neither create nor manage existing bookmarks.","The stated question covers the issue I believe.

OLD WAY OF CHANGING TABS???,"PLEASE PLEASE make it the way it was before. I use 'ctrl-tab' and 'ctrl-shift-tab' so much and I loved it the way it was before. It was simple, bloat-free, it worked, did exactly what I wanted. Now, it pops up some animation where it shows me the tabs and what's in them (and that only works when you first press 'ctrl-tab' btw. with 'ctrl-shift-tab' it doesn't work anymore, unless you first do 'ctrl-tab'.) And it's also slow (way slower than the old way at least). And also it doesn't just go through the tabs in the order that they're in up there. It's such an important feature to me that I will switch to another browser if this doesn't change back and I really don't want that. PLEASE change it back I love firefox ;;("

Win10 OS restored from recent config erased my FF book marks,"I experienced a Windows 10 bootup issue and decided to restore my Windows 10 OS from a (10-days previous) OS configuration. This corrected my Win10 boot issue, but when I ran FireFox it requested that I logon to my FireFox sync account to update my bookmarks. After logging in, nearly 4 years (hundreds) of well-organized bookmarks were gone and just a couple of bookmarks appeared. I have a FireFox account with both my PC and Phone listed. When viewing the ""FireFox Account"" page, there doesn't seem to be anyway to view the state or status any files being maintained by the FF account. I am wondering if the the FF sync process somehow moved the few bookmarks on my phone onto my PC. (Note: I noticed my PC appears to be listed twice on the device list.)I do have full backups of my PC available from a few months ago. So I either need to: 1) figure out if my ""full"" bookmarks set is recoverable from my FireFox account... or 2) I need instructions on how to bring back most of my FF bookmarks from a full PC backup from a few months ago. Thanks for your assistance!"
"I reset Firefox, now it's all but dead","I think I misunderstood how drastic ""reset Firefox"" would be, I have the tabs back but the only way I see the URLs they represent is to initiate autocomplete, then even when I click on the url I wanted it doesn't go to the site (sometimes I'll get the ""loading"" dots on the tab which leaves me even more perplexed)! I dunno was I obligated to set up sync before I did the reset? Nothing told me to do so or how to do it. I'm typing this on Chrome because it's still working OK but none of the pages come up on Firefox anymore. Can anyone explain how I can back this out of this disastrous condition? How would I know exactly what was causing it to be all but shut down like this? Tell me is this some kind of drastic overkill on security or something? Is there some SIMPLE test I can perform to quickly figure out what needs to be changed? The ONLY reason I did this was BEFORE I STARTED I couldn't get any downloads to proceed beyond zero bytes in size, so for right now I even bypassed Windows Firewall so I'm ""wide open"" looking for a solution, PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS THING WORKING AGAIN ASAP!!!"
How do I remove the lines above and below the navigation bar ?,"The attached image should make it clear as to which lines I'm referring to.I know about the .css file and I have some code in it. I think in particular to make bookmarks transparent, remove the line above a tab and move the tabs to the bottom.I am using a theme but that doesn't seem to be the problem since when I switch to Light theme, the lines persist albeit in different color. I tried the Default theme, but it's the Dark one and everything is black.So what code should I add to remove those lines ? Tell me if you want to see my entire css file.

"Bushwhack Update to v65 While in Complex Session Invoked Automatic ""Refresh"" and Created ""Old Firefox Data"" Folder on Desktop AND Changed Many Firefox Settings?","Today's Bushwhack Update to v65 While in Complex Session Invoked Automatic ""Refresh"" and Created ""Old Firefox Data"" Folder on Desktop AND Changed Many Firefox Settings?Windows 10 Pro; 64-bit; all updates present; all operations normal and stable... up until the subject event.I was minimizing my browser while working in my eMail client (Thunderbird). Firefox is default, so clicking links from Thunderbird is normally seamless. Came to pass that I clicked, re-clicked and double-clicked a few links - in relatively rapid succession, or what I'd call ""normal browsing"" - trying to determine if the eMail links were bad...When I attempted to maximize Firefox from the taskbar, it would not respond... It took about a moment for me to scratch my head, survey my desktop for anomalies or threat warning dialogs, messages, notices, etc., when Firefox icon disappeared and the Firefox update status bar information dialog flashed on my screen, saying something like ""please wait for Firefox to refresh..."" when it disappeared being instantly replaced by the updated Firefox's 'welcome screen' but in a new style which obscured nearly 3/4's of my desktop.After surveying the changes and NOTING FOR THE RECORD THAT ALL MY ADD-ONS AND EXTENSIONS HAD BEEN OBLITERATED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE WHATSOEVER, I resized my browser back to normal - which seems to have stuck and remains stable - where I discovered the 'Old Firefox Data' on my desktop:It weighs in at 61.4 MB; contains one inserted folder named ""edqs18xb.default"", as follows:C:\Users\[user name]\Desktop\Old Firefox Data\edqs18xb.default\these folders (sans contents... but can be supplied if necessary):adblockplus\bookmarkbackups\browser-extension-data\crashes\datareporting\extensions\features\gmp\gmp-eme-adobe\gmp-gmpopenh264\gmp-widevinecdm\healthreport\jetpack\minidumps\saved-telemetry-pings\storage\weave\webapps\Yahoo Inc\and these items:addons.jsonaddonStartup.json.lz4AlternateServices.txtautofill-profiles.jsonblocklist-addons.jsonblocklist-gfx.jsonblocklist-plugins.jsonblocklist.xmlbroadcast-listeners.jsoncert8.dbcert9.dbcert_override.txtcompatibility.inicontainers.jsoncontent-prefs.sqlitecookies.sqlitedh-ldata.jsonenumerate_devices.txtextension-settings.jsonextensions.jsonfavicons.sqliteflashctrl.sqliteformhistory.sqlitehandlers.jsonkey4.dbmemory-report.json.gzmimeTypes.rdfnotificationstore.jsonparent.lockpermissions.sqlitepersdict.datpkcs11.txtplaces.sqlitepluginreg.datprefs.jsreading-list.sqliterevocations.txtsearch-metadata.jsonsearch.jsonsearch.json.mozlz4secmod.dbSecurityPreloadState.txtserviceworker.txtsessionCheckpoints.jsonshield-preference-experiments.jsonshield-recipe-client.jsonSiteSecurityServiceState.txtstorage-sync.sqlitestorage.sqliteTelemetry.FailedProfileLocks.txttimes.jsonTRRBlacklist.txtwebappsstore.sqlitexulstore.jsonIt would be very nice and minimally respectful: to have been warned prior to such an invasive update; to be given an option to delay and prepare to accept the update - which deviates significantly from normal updates; and/or to publish some explanation and information and A LINK to a summary explanation with your braggadocios 'Welcome' page.As a manageable aside, many of the settings (under the Tools > Options menu) were also arbitrarily changed, most notably the desired default start page(s) and the manner to reset them. Most of the new defaults were not particularly dangerous however many more default settings tend to be a bit invasive and as the wording for each category changed significantly, a bit of research had to be done to analyze and determine whether to retain or change each and every one of these - which in no way matched the previous configuration I had so diligently conformed and maintained for quite a long time...I shouldn't need to compose a detailed complex question for true appropriate experts to project into this situation and conceive, formulate, and promulgate an appropriate constructive informative suggestive response with some variables and options for the many other Firefox clients who will likely experience this same trauma to an otherwise beautiful start of the day...Searching the help files and groups, the responses are non-responses and circle-logic which tend to justify placing a folder on the desktop - and various other arbitrary and capricious anomalies - in the first place without further explanation or options or suggestions... I am genuinely amazed that any of these non-responsive response have been archived and maintained as acceptable while the situation/situations seem to persist without any procedure or reasonable remedy to avoid it/them in the first place.I realize that Firefox is ""free"" and many dedicated experts selflessly sacrifice your experience and expertise to improve the internet browsing experience and generally make this imperfect world a better place in which to live, evolve, and thrive, but for your apparently socially uninformed information and for the record: it is NOT reasonable to expect people to be grateful for a reach-around when they didn't want the butt-raping in the first place.Please publish some options that may address my restoring my browser to it's previous comfortable settings using the 'Old Firefox Data' folder and/or its contents.PROCESSING NOTE: Uploading an image with this newly updated Firefox just glitched... looks like a Flash or Shockwave compatibility error from the progress icon. The Options > Tools > Add-ons and Extensions newly designed interfaces are not revealing any useful information... perhaps this new Firefox update categorizes its own image upload interface routine as ""dangerous""??? I'll insert a directory list... above... if I can safely exit this setback... With warmest regards."

Firefox doesnt open options menu and websites.,"Firefox cannot open any website or options menu. I tried to reinstall it multiple times. I removed Mozilla folders from ""Programs Files"", ""Program Files (x86)"" and from %appdata%. I tried installing both 32 and 64 bit version. I tried creating new profile and removing the default. I managed to open options once in safe mode just after one of many reinstallations of Firefox. I tried to disable hardware acceleration (also didn't work). After uninstalling the application I found Mozilla folder in many locations (for example C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local and C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow) i tried removing this as well. Somehow after opening Firefox for the first time after installation I got an information displayed on the bottom of the browser that said that Mozilla was previously installed on my computer and asking if I want to restore my settings. I also tried to run firefox with disabled antivirus software (I use Kaspersy) and it didnt work.This is an old netbook (acer aspire one 772) with windows 10. I recently decided to update its software and make it usable again. Firefox was installed on this computer but gui looked old so I decided to update it. I couldnt find the option for that in the application so I decided to uninstall it, download a new version from firefox website and install it again (and thats the moment when problems started)."

Only response was in that thread (then thread was locked)Question is and always is, why do you keep making alterations to firefox that are NOT needed (To note, I do not oppose changes people want, nor make others 'forced' to use it how I Like it -IE: tabs below address bar as one of many, many, examples, but why do you keep attempting to lock out changes?)I am getting very frustrated with firefox 'designers' who keep trying to find new ways to 'block' the ability to customize firefox the way WE, THE PEOPLE USING IT, want it to look/act. (IE removing junk we do not need/want -ie: bookmarks toolbar, etc) and moving elements where they feel most natural and intuitive to us(IE as the above, tabs below address bar)But each major update requires extensive userChrome.CSS modifications to 'fix' (And in some cases, never get back) simple things that we had set the way WE want.We have asked many, many, many times for you to STOP blocking our ability ot make these changes, yet each new major update, as i explained, we have to 'find new tricks' to fix the issue, when these options can simply be part of the customize firefox option(Btw another option that was requested multiple times, with us being utterly ignored)Please, I cannot be the only one whose getting frustrated to the point I'm almost pushed to go use google chrome instead."

How to unsync my Work PC & stop FF from asking me to sign in.,"When Firefox updated last time (on my PC at work), it opened with a page asking me to sign into my FF account. Stupidly, I signed in. Next time I looked, the Bookmarks Toolbar looked wrong and I realized that it is what I use at home, and I couldn't get to any of my work bookmarks. I finally figured out how to get them back, but I'd really like to get it back to where it's not asking me to sign in constantly. I'm also really upset that it changed my bookmarks. Not everyone knows how FF syncs and that signing in on the wrong computer will cause changes that will cost lost productivity. → → → → IT SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING BEFORE IT COMPLETES ANY ACTIONS! ← ← ← ←In other words, before it merged my bookmarks, it should have come up with a warning that explicitly said it was about to merge bookmarks from another computer, and ask if I really want to continue - as well as with any other action signing into your account does.

Restore previous session at start up now gives me amazon.co.uk instead of smileamazon.co.uk it used to work fine so what have you changed?,I have used restore previous session at start up with no problems for years. However from about a couple of weeks ago instead of restoring the smileamazon.co.uk tab it opens an amazon.co.uk tab. Because I did not notice at first I bought a couple of items from amazon and did not give the charitable donation. So clearly something has changed recently. Is this a Firefox issue or has Amazon changed something to reduce its charitable donations? I use a laptop with Windows 7.

How can I change the tab colors so they're different from the bookmarks toolbar color? I'm on a Mac.,"Firefox automatically updated on my iMac to v. 65 which moved things around and changed the colors. I just was able through the community forum to get the tabs back below the bookmarks toolbar, where they make more sense. However, the tab colors are now the same as the background for the address bar (I guess it's called that) and the bookmarks toolbar. In the previous version, the tabs were slightly darker so they stood out, and the selected tab was lighter so you could easily see which tab you were on. That's gone too. I've looked at theme add-ons and none of them will work for me. I just want a simple uncluttered browser page with easily visible tabs. The current theme I have is called Soft Aqua by Tracee. The color is fine; just need a way to make the tabs stand out. I've attached a screenshot of the way the browser used to appear and hope that someone can help me approximate the way it was. Thanks."

How can I downgrade Firefox 65 back to 64?,"After installing 65 on one of my systems, I noticed a number of user interface elements that didn't look right and for some reason my addon's page just showed blank rectangles where my addons would be, so I thought I'd downgrade to 64.

I tried reinstalling 64 again but it said something like the installation was in progress and wanted to reboot again, but again nothing happened. I had to select a new directory for the installation to get it to work.I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried it on another system... and same thing. So is there something unique about version 65 that is making the downgrade fail? What's the right way to downgrade this version?"
Firefox update to version 65.0.1 (from last night) erased my browser history,"I updated Firefox last night right before bed, to version 65.0.1.

I believe my bookmarks are intact (I do not typically use bookmarks, but there are a handful present, and I did not create them today, so I believe they are from before last night's update). I do use an add-on to record my open tabs, and it someone does go back longer than this, so maybe I can find some of the sites I used to have. However, I could really use the history feature, I have some stuff last summer I would like consult ASAP. I can verify that I have not manually erased my history, at least not going back before something I viewed within a given hour (I don't go back and erase things from say, yesterday, last week, last month, last year, etc).Any thoughts?"

Impossible to make my website with HTTPS wíth certificate,"Hello, there is a https:// setting that is destroying my charity project and (since my project is about creating funds for many charities), it's affection many other charities as well.I've got a website called Doelshop.nl which raises free donations for charities. This is done through affiliate marketing, someone buys something through my website (I'm just linking through) and 75% of the commission goes to the charity that the buyer chooses. The buyer doesn't pay anything extra. PROBLEM with Firefox/Google Chrome Many charities have applied (because they can get free donations through their users who are already shopping online), recently we have implemented in our system a function where each project can make their own subdomain. This means, if you have a charity called ABC, you can create ABC.doelshop.nl and automatically you have selected the ABC charity. Very handy for charities, because it's easy promotion. Now here's the problem, we have bought a SSL wildcard certificate to establish https:// connection for all these subdomains. BUT, some are typing into their URL boxes: www.abc.doelshop.nl and this CANNOT be certified. Technically it can if we manually insert every subdomain into multiple certificates, which would cost us thousands of dollars. Also our subdomains are not set, new ones are being created all the time. Both Firefox and Google Chrome now always give an error message when people type in their URL address with 'www.'. People cannot even reach the website, it gives un unsafe warning and shoppers won't donate for free to their charity. We have redirected the 'www.' to 'without www.' but this doesn't help. PLEASE HELP Is there any way where you could help, for example by listing these sub-subdomains as safe? I can give you any kind of openness to prove there is nothing scammy going on. I'm willing to change these domain setups towards Doelshop.nl/abc instead of abc.doelshop.nl but it takes a while. If you could list it as a safe connection in the meantime that would also mean a lot!Instead of using abc.doelshop.nl for testing, you can use https://make-a-wish.doelshop.nl (working) and https://www.make-a-wish.doelshop.nl (unsafe in your browser)"

There should be a default option in Firefox that keeps the whole history forever, not to delete all the previous history after 6 months, so that you shouldnt have to look up more addons to fix this very important issue (and then even hope that the addon actually works or wont lose anything after updates....)so this should be fixed ASAP..."

Does firefox prevent sites and javascript code from accessing existing cookies and web sites data when browsing in Private Browsing mode?,"In Private Browsing mode, the cookies, web site data and history is not maintained. However what about the existing data in firefox cache, like cookies and website cache data, i.e. data and trace that has been collected prior to starting the Private Browsing Mode.

turn off update nag,"I have version 64 installed. I am sick and tired of the update nag. I used to be able to turn it off. Now something has tried to update something so every time I open firefox my os asked me if I want to let firefox update my computer. NO I DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And don't preach to me about security as a need for updates. I get it, I understand it, but its not always convenient for me to update every time you decide to release an update.....which is why I don't want to be nagged every time I open the browser.I will update once. If that doesn't give me an option to get rid of the nag I will downgrade to the last version that will allow me to get rid of the nag.....and then I will NEVER UPDATE AGAIN. If the browser gets too old to work then I will just stop using Firefox.Good job. You went from being my favorite browser to my least favorite over night."

the scrounge tool to view lost session tabs seems broken ... I am trying to restore lost tabs/windows,"Hi Jscher2000,I am using Firefox version 65.0.2I tried using your tool to view tabs in firefox profile files, but I dont think its working for me. I dragged a file onto https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html. I then clicked the SCROUNGE button. I just see a bunch of encoded text in the 'file contents box'. The file I dragged and dropped was previous.jsonlz4 from c:\users\matt\appdata\roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\profiles\5120jgru.defaul\sessionstore-backups\previous.jsonlz4Is the tool broken? I read on another thread that I should see tabs, and be bale to click on them to open them. (I was hoping to copy see the contents of my recovery file, and if correct, then copy previous.jsonlz4 over my recovery.jsonlz4 file, to restore my lost windows. I also have a upgrade.jsonlz4-20190211233335 file, that looks to be the same size as previous.jsonlz4, as my problem happened after a firefox update. After the Firefox update, I had to click the RESTORE PREVIOUS SESSON command after I restarted Firefox. What happened after the update is 2 of the 4 firefox windows did not get any restored tabs, but 2 of the windows did get restored tabs. so I mistakenly closed those two windows without tabs by clicking on the 'X' in the upper right hand corners. I then restarted firefox, and only 2 of the 4 windows opened although those two did have the correct restored tabs.So, I have two questions:1) is the scrounger tool broken?2) will copying previous.jsonlz4 to recovery.jsonlz4 restore all tabs in all 4 windows? (ALso should I copy it over recovery.baklz4 also? They have the smae dates and file sizesInterestingly the upgrade.jsonlz4-20190211233335 file previous.jsonlz4 have the same date and size too?(PS: I could not copy/paste the screenshot?

How to disable left click trigger on focused item when spacebar is pressed?,"Hello,When I have an element focused in a web page, and press the spacebar, Firefox triggers a click on that item.It is especially annoying if I clicked the play button on any major streaming website, including YouTube or Deezer, and then when I try to pause the video using the spacebar, the following two things happen:1. Default website functionality triggers a change in media state (from play to pause and vice versa)2. Firefox behavior triggers a click on that item, inverting the state brought on by 1, and effectively rendering the spacebar useless. The playback goes from paused to play to paused instantly.I started noticing this behavior with the more recent versions of Firefox.Is there a way to disable this behavior, so that I can use the spacebar for play/pause functionality like in other browsers?Thank you"

Delayed start of music stream using V. 65.0.2,"When I launch the Radio Forge music player (a Wordpress plugin based on the Muse player) from my website (https://RadioFreeAmericana.com) using Firefox V. 65.0.2, there is about a 20 to 30 second delay until the music starts playing. (Listeners have also confirmed this phenomenon.) I am running Wordpress 5.1.The problem is isolated to the new Firefox browser, as there is no problem with the audio stream and the Radio Forge music player works fine with other browsers (including the previous Firefox V. 64.0.2) -- as it has for over a year.What could be causing this delay? Is it some sort of Firefox validation process? How can the delay be eliminated? Is there a Firefox configuration setting that can address this issue?To be clear, Firebox is not blocking the player, nor does Firefox issue a warning message. It's just a delayed start of the player, as if Firebox is validating something before ""agreeing"" to stream the audio. You can see for yourself by clicking Listen at https://RadioFreeAmericana.com.Thanks for any insights."

Firefox 66 (macOS) reverting to playing YouTube videos automatically,"I finally some months ago had managed to stop Firefox 63 (plus 64 and 65) from playing videos (i. e. on YouTube) automatically. In the course of finding the solution for this I had been told here in the forum that ""no autoplay"" would become the default in a future version of Firefox.One or two days ago I then read that Firefox 66 would finally do this. Great. However, after updating to Firefox 66 videos on YouTube play again (unlike in my Firefox 65 with modified settings) automatically and with sound - blissfully ignoring the setting ""Block websites from automatically playing sound"" in the Firefox preferences.With all due respect: Is this a joke? It was possible before to disable autoplay, now not anymore - what's the progress here? What is good about disabling the disabling of autoplay? And, no, youtube.com is not in my exceptions list (nothing is).How can this be fixed?"

BUG history is NOT deleted when restarting after update,"In my options, I have ""Clear history when Firefox closes"" set (about:preferences#privacy tab). This normally works fine...except...if the reason for closing Firefox is to do an update via Help | About Firefox. This has been a problem at least going back to Firefox 57.

Similarly, you will see cookiesGeneral comment:I can think of few times it isn't MORE essential to clear out history or cookies (if that's the user's choice) than when applying an update. After all, many updates are required by of security vulnerabilities, many from unknowing/hijacked sites!I suspect that the problem here is the order in which things are getting done for an update, or that the update routine just ignores normal shutdown/restart protocols entirely and does its own thing independent of user settings. If the latter is the case and it ""really needs to be"" that way (I doubt it — that's a common refrain I've been hearing for decades with complex programs and I have not once come across an instance in which it was more than a convenience for the programmers), there should at minimum be a flag or warning that ""When Firefox was restarted, it did not do a normal shutdown. If your settings require certain actions on shutdown (like clearing history or cookies), that may not have occurred."""

After changing pw Firefox does NOT ask to save the new pw & does NOT autofill with new pw even after manually changing pw mgr & restarting my mac. Why?,Firefox version: 66.0.2 Computer: Mac OS 10.13.6 I just changed my web mail password. The new password was accepted by the web mail site. The old password does NOT work. The new password DOES. I restarted the computer after making the change. When I signed back into my web mail site I had to input my new password. Firefox DID NOT ask to save the new password. (This feature IS turned on in the preferences.) When I signed out of Web mail and signed back in the NEW password was NOT automatically filled in. I went to the password manager and MANUALLY changed the password. I signed out of the web mail site and restarted the computer. When I signed back into the web mail site it STILL AUTOMATICALLY input the OLD password and I had to manually input the new one. I checked the password manager and the NEW password is there with today's date as the last time it was changed. I checked other sites with saved passwords and they still operate as the always have.Why is this happening? What can I do to get it to ask & populate properly?

Acquire Microphone restriction from Multiple tabs,I have given allow permission for Microphone in my domain. We are using our domain in multiple tabs. I am able to acquire local media (Microphone) when I am accessing in the same tab. But I am not able to acquire local media for WebRTC in the other tab(same domain) without visiting the tab in which I was trying to acquire. Is it intentionally done for Security & Privacy? . Is there any way to solve my problem ? Reason: To restrict resources being used for WebRTC session. We are keeping WebRTC session in single tab for our domain and using only that resource for all the tabs to make calls. Thanks in advance. Matt
Wordpress site reloading couples of times only on firefox,"Hi there,We have a mystery which is polluting our data on all the analytic tool that we are currently using such as google analytics.

Blank screen appears when I do a search in a new tab using duck duck go,"I have Duck Duck Go set as my default search engine and home page.Whenever I try to do a web search using duck duck go after opening a new tab, the search results return blank.

How can I disable hardware acceleration in the newest Firefox 66.0.3?,Youtube is no longer playing my videos with my Firefox 66.0.3. I am using a Macbook pro with macOSMojave.

My title bar is gone with the latest update. How do I get it back?,"I accepted the latest update, and now the window frame looks weird. The title bar is missing. Or rather, maybe it is more appropriate to say that the title bar and the menu bar seem to be merged. There is only one bar at the top of the window. It doesn't contain a Firefox icon or window title, but does contain the menu and, on the right side, the minimize, restore, and close buttons.I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug, but in either case I'd prefer to go back to the traditional layout. I've looked for relevant options, but I can't find any.Can anyone shed some light on what is going on?-TC"
Is there a plugin/add-on that might display jpeg 2000 images ?,"I often use some images compressed in jpeg 2000 format (.jp2) It's very useful as it offers a high compression level, even in lossless mode.As of now, whenever I need to watch a .jp2 image, I have to download it and open it in a software (and then use the file explorer to delete it if the image is not the right one). It would be much comfortable to be able to see these images directly in the browser and not wasting time to download and open file with another software to see if the image matches my needs.Is there a plugin/add-on that might display jpeg 2000 images in Firefox ? (or best, is it planned to implement this function in later releases ?)"
Firefox is showing websites I have not asked for on Google,"Since just recently, when I google anything other than a specific site (and then sometimes), Firefox puts up above it a whole string of ""answers"" that are mainly adverts (but not marked as such), irrelevant and don't even contain the search term. This junk pushes my wanted results half way down the page or more, quite often.Not only this, but the kind of site i am looking for appears first, and then swiftly following it, but appearing above, come the intrusive advert sites - so I go to hit the site I want, and end up clicking an unwanted site that springs up under my cursor. I am learning to be more cautious.Just now a string of holiday sites came up above my wanted entries - nothing to do with holidays or locations or shopping at all.This does not appear to happen on Google on other browsers, though I only have a limited sample.Is this something I can fix in Firefox, or is it a Google problem?Thank you for any insights."

Unwanted website keeps opening automatically even after blocking.,"An unwanted tab keeps opening by itself on my browser whether my browser is open or closed.

Why does Firefox keep crashing?,"Since several days Firefox crashes after only a few minutes of uses regardless of the site on which I am on. I tried to restart in Safe Mode but nothing has changed.

Bare-metal install - which files are critical to back-up to get back to where I was?,"I back-up my files off-site daily and I've noticed quite a few unknown type files such as ""https+++"" among others.Some of these are quite large adding to the back-up time and I'm sure most of them are not needed.So, my question is: If my computer was damaged beyond repair or stolen, which files/folders would I need to get me back to the last time I used Firefox?I'm still using Firefox v. 55.0.3 as the later updates do not allow me to use the ""Manage Tabs"" add-on and that is the best feature by far for me. W/o that add-on I may as well be using Chrome."
Why can't I save a bookmark using the create bookmark and why does return not go to a URL,"I am not able to create a book mark using the star on the toolbar or the command D keystrokes. I also cannot type in a URL and get there by hitting enter, only by clicking on the go arrow on the right side of the url slot. I recently installed Firefox ESR and it came up with my bookmarks that I had in the standard version. ESR is required for some applications in our corporate systems.HELP!!THANKS"
How do I find the directory that a bookmark is in?,"Having a search ""feature"" that does not immediately come up with not only the bookmark but also it's location in the bookmark folders is frankly useless. It has been driving me crazy for years, and is what eventually made me give up on Firefox. Yes I know there are extensions that can do this (though I am now a bit out of the loop and don't know of any current ones) but they are simply not the solution. Extensions change and are often disabled after an upgrade leaving me to scramble looking for yet another half assed solution.Imagine if the file manager on your operating system allowed you to find the words ""idiot"" in a file somewhere on your system but didn't give you any way to actually find the location of this file in your system without lots of extra work! That would be completely unacceptable - Well that is what I have with Firefox!As users, lazy developers of all sorts of software have tried for years to force us to store our snippets of data in one gigantic box and then force us to rely on searching, sometimes for ages to find whatever it is we put in that box.This is not how organized people like to work. Putting every single tool I own in a big box in my garage would be insane and using that system would be just as insane on a computer or in an application.We generally put woodworking tools together, mechanic type tools together, measurement tools together, electronics tools together. Then when we need that funny little thing we use to pry open mobile phones, we can find it, even though we don't know its name or exactly where it is, it is with the electronics tools, we go to that box, drawer or wall-board and ah, there it is, no unpacking a huge box of unrelated tools (The thing we are looking for is always at the bottom).Well my bookmarks are the same. There are times when a directory system does not help and then I rely on searching but most the time my work flow is like this:Today I am working on a robotics thing. I remember seeing a cool little motor I came across when I last worked on robotics stepper motors I remember the name of the stepper motor so I search for it. It shows me the directory I put it in and presto there too I find the information I saved about the other cool little motor. I have this happen over and over. This the only reason I save bookmarks. Hell if I am going to throw all bookmarks into a single box an use search then why bother with bookmarks at all? I can just use Google or DuckDuckGo or whatever other search engine takes my fancy!If there are other people out there that feel like I do, please note your irritation here so that those wonderful people who give so much of their time to improving Firefox can know that this is a big issue.If there is a new search tool that also shows the directory structure, please bring it to my attention.BTW, I am whining a lot in this post but it is because I love Firefox and really miss using it. If programming were my passion rest assured this is something I would be happy to help with but it is not, my skills lie in other areas where I regularly contribute to the good of others. Thank you Firefox developers.My bookmarks have become quite messy since losing the ability to easily find things and I want to bring them back into line. I miss being able to find stuff I liked.Oh and please don't tell me ""Tags"" - tags are another half assed solution for this workflow. Tags have their place and are useful but not for keeping things organized. They are too reliant on searching. Tags: So all my tools are in one box with a sticky label tagging some as woodworking, some as metalworking, some as electronics - that is still one very big, very messy hard to work with box of garbage!-Dennis"

Firefox not saving tabs/losing previous sessions,"This has happened across two of my computers. Over the past week, seemingly randomly about 5 times so far, Firefox will not restore the tabs from my previous session (neither will it have a clickable option to anywhere) when I close and reopen it. I've had to resort to bookmarking all my tabs before I close Firefox if I remember to just to be safe. I've tried clearing my history entirely and starting fresh, which seemed to fix it before but didn't this time, and I've double-ensured the option to restore the previous session is indeed checked.Is there a reason this could be happening or a way to fix it? It seems as if the option to restore the previous session upon reopening is not reliably working as intended."

"Clicking ""Login with Facebook"" does nothing on Firefox, works on Edge","With Firefox, when I click on ""Login with Facebook"" on Zomato (zomato.com), nothing happens. However, if I click on ""Login with Google"" it opens a new window to choose which Google account I want to use. And when I try to do the same on Microsoft Edge it works (both Zomato and Google) so it's not a Zomato problem. I've tried to use Standard Content Blocking, I've disabled the option ""Block pop-up windows"", and nothing worked. The weird thing is, I could login with Google if I wanted, the window opens, but not with Facebook.This is even more frustrating because I wanted to be automatically logged in, since I'm also logged in on Facebook and it should recognize that I want to use my Facebook account on Zomato.I wanted to insert a screenshot, showing it working on Edge, but I couldn't upload it :/Thank you so much in advance!"

Firefox Is Changing The Default Paper Size For All Printers When One Is Selected,"Hello!A little background info on what we're dealing with here. I work in a store and we own two workstations. Each workstation shares our two printers. One is a Star Receipt printer, the other is a Brother full size paper printer. Now Workstation2 is working without issue. We are able to print with the system specific default printer settings and nothing changes between printer. All good to go.Now the issues stems from Workstation1. Our Star Receipt printer is set to print '77MMXRECEIPT', however when we select the Brother printer from the drop down menu then switch back to the Star Receipt the default paper size is forced to 'Letter' which causes the Receipt to print like a large sheet of paper which means we only get a portion of what we are printing.This wouldn't normally be a problem, but due to some undefined steps(I'm not the only user and we don't always print from one website) the Brother printer is changed to default in Firefox which means that when we select the Receipt printer for printing, the default is again set to 'Letter' until we go to File>Print and set it to default again with '77MMXRECEIPT'.Here's what I've done to test where the issue is this. I've changed and confirmed that when the Receipt printer is forced to 'Letter', the windows printer settings for both printers does stay on the default settings. I've also confirmed that the printer settings work on all browsers but Firefox and within Firefox I have gone into the .js settings file and deleted anything mentioned as 'print_' as well as going to Help>Troubleshoot>Refresh and completely setting all settings to default with nothing changing. I've also gone into About:config and tried resetting the default printer to no avail. The setting is always forcefully changed to 'Letter' when first switched to Brother printer and back to Star Receipt printer.My take on it is there is some saved cache or settings file that has recorded and saved the Brother settings along with the Star Receipt settings and sets them both when switched to Brother. I've attempted to check both workstations and compare settings, everything appears the same. I have no idea where else to go on this as I don't know Firefox that intimately. Short of reinstalling Firefox I've done all I can think of. My current version of Firefox is 66.0.3 (64-bit) labelled as Firefox Quantum.Please let me know if there is anything you can think of! Thank you for your help."

"Task Manager shows FLOW and FIREFOX Using large amount of CPU, If I terminate FLOW it returns to normal, but comes back!","For the last week Task Manager is showing Firefox using lots of CPU, causing fans to come on in laptop, at the same time 'FLOW' is showing about the same high usage. I never installed Flow. When I 'end task' on Flow Firefox reverts to normal. But Flow reappears on it's own. If I remove Conexant Flow, it comes back again. Can anyone help?

Is this punishment for doing an update?,"After doing an update it would have been nice to receive a notification to let me know that I should restart the browser but instead I am being prevented from opening a link in a new tab just because I have updated the browser among other things in the background. This is will only serve to discourage me from doing an update while I'm using the browser. Now it says that I could have restored the session but as you tell by the little purple mask in the top right corner of the image I've uploaded- I was using the browser in Private-mode so that won't happen and I will get a ""Firefox is having trouble restoring your tabs"" message if I did a reboot. I had typed whole bunch of stuff in one tab and I had ended up loosing that because I couldn't open a link in a new tab (using Ctrl+left-Click). Now even if a person isn't in Private-mode there are still plenty of reasons for not doing a reboot right after an update like it's possible that a person has to wait for internet access forcing a reboot like this will only make people curse the developers. In my case obviously I was in a private session and I wanted to finish working on something before doing a reboot and in the mean time I should be able to use the browser normally like would be able to use it if I hadn't done an update. In short people shouldn't be prevented from opening a link in new tab just because they've updated the browser. That should go without saying.Just to mess with the user there's a nice little cartoon on the left with an unplugged extension cord."

Clicking on the icon calls up the ""reconnect to Sync"" message. I cannot sign in, seeming to be a password problem. Please note, I do not remember ever enrolling into a FF account. That could be a fault of memory, but I typically note when, where, user id, and password or other important data when registering.First question: does FF sometimes 'loses it' causing similar problems? If so, what is the solution to the problem?Or, am I screwed? I looked around trying to find soluitons before coming here but only found disheartening info.Stephen"

Clearing cookies and cache several ways don't help,I bought hosting which came with free domain name registration from WordPress & almost immediately regretted it. For a little more elsewhere I could've got more space to upload things to & I could've used all the plug-ins I wanted. Well I couldn't do anything about the domain name but I was refunded the hosting. I got hosting elsewhere & pointed my domain name to it but when visiting my site was directed to https & got an error message. Somewhere/some way I found out I can't use the s in https anymore. But no matter what I do I'm redirected back to https & either the error message or the site again freely hosted at WordPress.com.Clearing the cookies & cache in only one way rarely works. I usually have to clear them in several ways. Then I can get to my site on my new host. But working on wp-admin both via my new host or WordPress's software or checking out themes or plugins sends me back to WordPress.com or https. Then I have to clear everything several ways again. So what should've taken me no time has taken me forever & I'm no where close to done.I just changed my free subdomain's name hoping to end the conflict but I don't think I did plus now even though I've cleared every way possible I can't get back to my new host's site.

"Firefox is very flaky recently - website functions (Amazon, Home Depot, Edmunds) no longer work as they used to but are fine in Chrome","Over the last few weeks I have noticed issues with many websites using Firefox. Here's a summary of what I've experienced:1. My local newspaper site (thechronicleherald.ca) will freeze up for several seconds when you click on any story before it eventually releases and works.2. The message boards at Edmunds (forums.edmunds.com) which use message board software from Vanilla, use drop-downs when composing a message to add photos, links or emoticons. These have become usually non-responsive though every now and then they work.3. Attempting to log into my homedepot.ca account I could not get past the sign-in screen as it returned error messages about entering a valid email address and password even though those were auto-filled, and the ""sign in"" button was unresponsive.4. I can no longer update a previously posted review on Amazon.ca because for whatever reason it will only take me to the page where you create a new review when you click the edit function. These are the ones I encountered just today. I do not like using Chrome because I have been faithful to Firefox for over a decade but this is becoming ridiculous.

I had them both set up to automatically restore the last session which was working well. I am no longer able to restore from an old session.

"Firefox Awesome bar suggestions don't work, bookmarks won't add or delete (Fixed)","I encountered peculiar behaviour in Firefox (Macbook Pro / High Sierra). The Firefox Awesome bar (address/search bar) stopped showing suggestions. It did show some suggestions but only after typing 'http://'. After weeks of torment I discovered that the problem wasn't limited to the awesome bar itself – the history and bookmarks stopped working properly as well. History ceased displaying recently visited sites (only the ones I visited weeks ago) while I also could not add or delete bookmarks ('Bookmark this page' and 'Delete bookmark' functions didn't do a thing). I tried many fixes, starting off by googling for solutions. I tried clearing cache, disabling search suggestions and enabling them again under Preferences, reinstalling Firefox, resetting PRAM, updating my OS. None of the above fixes worked. I fixed all the problems by following this guide on repairing faulty bookmarks: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cant-add-change-or-save-bookmarksRemoving the xulstore.json and places.sqlite files and restarting Firefox did the job, everything is working smoothly again. I'm sharing this in case there are others like me, who are searching for a fix to the awesome bar only and not to the bookmarks or history."

I had set up extensions with new directions to allow the specific extensions to be downloaded.Constant message can't find server col122.mail.live.com, when Firefox opens and sometimes this occurs when proxy setting has changed on its own . But this ""can't find server"" message shows up almost every time I open Firefox and is NOT always associated with proxy changes. This update has been a BIG HEADACHE !! AND THEN TODAY THE WHOLE THING CRASHED my computer. It took me over 5 hours to get my computer up and running again. However, I am Still getting the message ""can't find server col122.mail.live.com"" and proxy changes randomly.HELP PLEASE"
"I need add-ons for old version of firefox , I can,t update browser , I can,t buy new hardware , help me","So many people are very poor and they can not buy new and strong computer hardware , But Firefox force us to use new hardware because new version need new hardware , and new add-ons need new version browser ... It is unfair , What dose add-ons do for us that you force us to buy new hardware? , whereas we have not enough money ... Is not Mozilla a non-profit organization ? For example in Iran, internet censored by criminal government and we strongly need free ""VPN add-ons"" at old versions of Firefox ... (especially 47 & less) Thanks for your notice چرا نمیگذارید از افزونه ها در نسخه های قدیم فایرفاکس استفاده کنیم ؟ ما نمیتوانیم نسخه جدید مرورگر را بکار ببریم چون پول کافی برای خرید سخت افزار کامپیوتر جدید نداریم . مگر یک افزونه چه میکند که اینگونه لازم به بروزرسانی باشد ؟ بگذارید از همان نسخه های قدیم استفاده کامل بکنیم ، مگر بنیاد موزیلا غیرانتفاعی نیست ؟ پس چه فایده ای دارد که مردم را مجبور به خرید کامپیوتر جدید کنید ؟بطور مثال در ایران اینترنت توسط حکومت جنایتکار سانسور میشود و ما نیاز فراوان به فیلترشکن از نوع افزونه ای داریم ، لطفا اینقدر ما را اذیت نکنید! سپاس از توجه شما"

"Trying to Sync ""out"" from my current Firefox setup, not pull a previous Sync ""in"".","Hi all,I've searched and read all I can about his topic but although I see many that are almost exactly like it, I don't see any that are exactly like it. The advice to set Firefox with all bookmarks, extension, etc. like I want it then click ""Disconnect"" in Sync the reconnect is a common ""fix"" but it does not work.The problem is this: Evidently, some time ago I did a sync on some device or another that had Firefox, possibly Ubuntu on my laptop. Also evident is the fact that the bookmarks, extensions, etc. are a huge mess in that sync.Now when I re-installed Firefox on my desktop yesterday and placed my good backup of the profile into the proper profile folder, which is exactly like I want everything , all is good at this point, I then sign in to Sync and instantly the ""bad"" sync comes ""in"" and garbles everything into a mess.So my question is whether there is a way (I'm sure it's simple, I'm just dense) to use this current Firefox on my desktop to be the ""master"" that all other devices sync to? I just described above what happens when I set it exactly like I like it then sign in to sync, so that's no good as a solution.Thank you in advance for any assistance you may be able to provide."

I have a development copy of the website on my hard disk, and that displayed fine too until Firefox 68.0; but now it uses the second font in my list, instead of the first.So: some bug in the code of the copy on my disk, I thought. But when I open it in Safari, Chrome or Brave, it displays correctly.The W3C CSS validation service finds no error in the code.I'm stumped. Any ideas?"

"Why is Firefox rendering pages with the ""Last Resort"" font replacing some or all text? Chrome and Safari are not having this issue.","I recently had a font management program affect the fonts on my computer in an unexpected and unwanted manner. Immediately after this happened Firefox was no longer rendering type correctly on a number of webpages. Some were completely compromised with ""Last Resort"" (i.e., rounded boxes with question marks for each character) replacing all text, and some with only certain portions affected. At the time I did not check other browsers to see if/how they were affected.I replaced/reinstalled the Mac system fonts, and reinstalled around 90% of the additional fonts that I've collected over the years, however, Firefox was still having issues. At this point I uninstalled Firefox and pulled down a fresh copy, cleared all caches, and checked both Chrome and Safari. Firefox is still not working correctly and the other two browsers show no sign of the problem (if they ever had it all). Attached are screen shots of my My Yahoo! page in Chrome and Firefox showing the results of the issue.I would really love to keep using Firefox, but this problem would be a deal breaker.CheersRandy"

Firefox won't let me drag-and-drop files from automatically-opened .zip archives into Windows Explorer,"I am using Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit (fully updated) and Firefox 68.0 64-bit.The problem is that when I download any .zip archive and tell Firefox to ""Open with... 7-Zip File Manager"" (or with Windows Explorer), after the archive has finished downloading and opened in a 7-Zip window (or an Explorer window), I cannot drag-and-drop the file contained in the archive onto a Windows Explorer window or the desktop. No matter where I try to drag the file to, the Windows mouse cursor is always a ""cancel"" icon and won't let me drop it anywhere.If I then close the archive window and reopen it from the download folder (C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Temp), now I can drag-and-drop correctly.I know that this is a problem with Firefox, because if I try the same operation with the same .zip archive using the current version of Tor Browser (8.5.4 32-bit (based on Mozilla Firefox 60.8.0esr)) or with Internet Explorer (11.0.9600.19399) I do not have this problem.Any help would be appreciated."

Feature request for Firefox desktop: Button to hide/show tab bar,"I frequently edit the css sheet to disable the tab bar, then go back later and edit it again to bring it back.A good thing about safari is that the top bar is tiny when you have only one page open, so you can shrink the window and stick it in the corner pretty well.A button (maybe under view) to hide/show the tab bar would be sweet, if that's possible.

Adding dyslexic friendly fonts to Firefox Reader Mode?,"I'm not sure where to ask, but I'll start here and will follow up anywhere else that this may need to be moved to. I noticed Reader Mode which is an amazing feature of Firefox only supports two font options: Serif and Sans-Serif. It would be great for people who are dyslexic to have open sourced dyslexic friendly fonts as options for the Reader Mode fonts.The reason being: Reader Mode could be used to enhance the web experience. I sometimes use Reader Mode in already hard to parse through websites (ad infested sites, with anti adblocker features) and some sites don't account for those who have dyslexia. Reader Mode can bridge the gap for these people and others who might wind up on legacy / really old websites that wont be updated (thinking of Space Jam).One candidate would be OpenDyslexic:https://opendyslexic.org/"

Restore (very) old non-saved Firefox session.,"A year ago Windows forced an update (that I'd been delaying a long time) while my computer was asleep. My tabs that usually automatically restored, didn't do so as usual. Didn't know if I could restore it (though knew it might be possible), but I was too busy at the time to learn it. Just had to accept it was gone to get done with my tasks the coming weeks. Sorry, long story. The problem: It happened again now, but I succesfully restored the session from sessionstore-backups with the .jsonlz4 file. Question is: I would like to restore last years session too. In the sessionstore-backups folder I can only find files from a month back. Is it ANY way to restore/find the URLs in the active tabs, from last year. I know it's a long shot, but it was VERY important to me! Thank you my fellow foxes."
Why is Google image information panel there again/gone again?,"My job requires searching for often a lot of images on Google. I am not sure if this is a Google of a Firefox problem. In this past week there has been a new information frame appear. Before when one clicked on an image it would be highlighted amid the search grid with some associated information (original site, image size etc). Now this pops out as a separate panel to the right of my browser screem. Due to the quick way I need to work, this is cumbersome and annoying.Also if I right clicked and opened an image in a new tab, it would open with the image filling two-thirds of the screen on the left, which gave a decent view of it. On the right hand panel would be the information about site, title, caption etc. Now all of this is squished into a portrait sized panel that looks as though it has been designed for a tablet or phone. It also means with each image I am having to conduct an additional action to right click to expand to full size so I can actually get a decent view of what it is because it has been so squished down to only medium size by all the other data.My question is this. Up until a few days ago this panel was not there. It would occasionally appear sometimes, especially if I was logged into a Google account but mostly not and would be gone next time I searched. From my investigation of this it is something that appears with some browsers and not others. If this is something that does/doesn't appear in Firefox, how do i make it go away?My question is is how do I make this pop-up panel go away and just get the regular old image highlight? Much easier and less messing around to use, not to mention actually offered a better and clearer view of what the image actually was."
How to remove black recktangle in the upper left corner of browser window?,Recently I reinstalled my Windows 10 and downloaded the new version of Firefox Browser (68.0.1).

"Since upgrading to Firefox 68, and opening a Firefox account, ALL of my tabs have been lost - is there a step-by-step guide to restoring them?","I upgraded to Firefox 68. Because I had add-ons (like Nexus screenshot and others) I was prompted to open a Firefox account in order to make them work. I did this, and the system worked well that day (4th August). Today I needed to use Firefox for work and all of my tabs have been lost. I cannot work out how to restore them. There is ""Old Firefox Data"" folder on my desktop (although it only seems to be as recent as November 2018). When I try to open bookmarkbackups it gets locked in a loop of asking me if I want to open or save it in Internet Explorer, but never actually opens it.If I had known I'd have these problems I would never have upgraded or opened a Firefox account!"

Shift Sticky Key disabled in Firefox,"Ctrl, Alt and the Windows Sticky Keys work. It's only Shift.This started some time in April. Shift worked prior to me having to reset Windows.

I thought something went wrong during the install, so I did it again.It still didn't work.I, avtually, had to do another full reset because, believe it or not, a wireless keyboard did something to my PC. After wiping everything, yet again, and after installing Firefox, the Shift Sticky Key doesn't work in the browser.Is it Windows or the Browser?Well, it works in Edge. And for some reason, only Edge.So, what happened?Why has the Shift Sticky Key been disabled?"

Then I tried some and it fills it in. However as soon as I leave the browser it ""deselects"" that box and it no longer works. I suspect this is due to some update, but would really appreciate it if I had knowledge of this change before hand and also how to fix it so that it works like it should. Thanks."

FF won't open maximized on mon2 when mon1 is fullscreen,"Using Win10 and FF 68.0.2I have two taskbar menu shortcuts, one opens FF maximized on monitor1, the other opens FF maximized on monitor2.

Its as though FF realizes that it has an instance open in full screen mode and that's why it opens the next instance in non-maximized mode. I am hoping someone can tell me how to have the second instance override this behavior so it will open maximized on monitor2 like it always does. Thanks.EDIT: When I say fullscreen I was referring to a browser video being played full screen, although the issue is the same when using the normal F11 full screen and there is no video."

Retreiving bookmarks after starting Firefox in safe mode,A few months ago I started Firefox in safe mode ( I don't remember why because it was so long ago). After quitting Firefox and starting it up again I lost ALL my bookmarks and other settings (my profile). I researched how to find them again but it would not let me install the old profile. It simply refused to return to the older profile for some kind of security issue. Can anyone explain why this happened and how I can at least get my old bookmarks back?P.S. The reason I didn't report this earlier is that there was NO WAY I could access this support area even through my account.

Pixiv Content loading problem with muiltiple tabs,"Hi, I'm making the switch to FireFox and trying to work out the kinks. Hopefully someone can advise on this. On the website Pixiv.net Firefox seems to have trouble loading some of the tabs when I go from image to image after opening maybe 20 or so tabs. The content on the page is gray and requires a manual refresh. This does not happen in Chrome. Not sure if someone is able to reproduce this on another computer. Screenshot attached. I have plenty of memory 16GB with an i7 Processor. On Windows 7 Ultimate.To reproduce, search for a tag in pixiv like car for example. Then open 20 or so tabs and sift through them. Some of the tabs content will not show anything. Pretty much occurs every time randomly.Edit 9/2/19: I'll keep this question up since someone may want to reference and fix it. I moved back to Chrome, there are just way too many issues with FireFox that still need to be addressed, especially the over aggressive filter modes in In Private windows. Turning them off do absolutely nothing."

Firefox cannot play certain Twitter gifs on Windows 7,"Examples of broken gifs:https://twitter.com/wannaODIN_/status/1169143681976283136https://twitter.com/RedTestament/status/1169139822100930561https://twitter.com/_t3nshi/status/1169122796573736960As far as I can tell, this is mainly a Windows 7 problem. I have done a fair bit of testing with gifs I've made myself, and while I don't exactly know how gif ""encoding"" or whatever works, it seems to be a problem with how Twitter converts certain gif versions.If I make a gif with Aseprite 1.2.13-x64 the gifs do not work, and show up as black. However you can still download them as a video, reupload them, and then they work, which is kinda weird but I assume twitter re-converts the videos into something else.However if I make the same gif with Aseprite 1.2.9 which is at least a year older, they work on Twitter.I've seen some references about H.264 Level 5.2 not working on Windows 7, and maybe that might be the issue? If so, is there any way to get Level 5.2 media to play on Windows 7? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1479203#c10Using MediaInfo to check the files of the videos in question they say that they are using AVC (Main@L5.2) (CABAC / 4 Ref Frames), while the ""gifs"" (yes I know that they are just videos on Twitter) that DO work are AVC (Main@L5)."

"Windows 10 - Firefox no longer plays videos on twitter, netflix etc","I recently had a windows update on my desktop, since then videos on netflix and twitter (and a few other sites) will no longer play.

I don't have her machine to hand to grab versions from there but everything is up to date at time of writing and I've tried the same troubleshooting techniques on that machine as well.Really stumped on this one and I'm very reluctant to switch back to Chrome simple to play netflix videos, but likewise it's quite important I can play videos around the web.

"In Firefox Quantum version 69, each bookmark has :name, location, tags, and keyword; but no ""description"" section like previous editions.

When I changed the Firefox edition to the Quantum I was shocked and disappointed to discover that, after all these pass years of use thereof, the indispensable ""description"" section was not visible. Please, tell me if it is possible to remedy this problem? If it is a feature of Quantum to phase out the ""description, then I will necessarily revert to using a different edition of Firefox that has the ""description"" section for each bookmark."

"when will Mozilla support Expect-CT, a new security header","""Expect-CT is a new security header which is, at the moment, only supported by Chrome and Opera browsers. It allows a website to instruct the browser to reject any certificate not found in Certificate Transparency, a read-only public log of certificates which can be audited. Because Expect-CT is an HTTP header, it is a trust-on-first-use protocol that relies on long-term caching to ensure security. While Expect-CT does not prevent a compromised Certificate Authority from issuing a fake certificate, it does limit the damage by forcing the addition of the certificate to the log. The domain owner can then report the fake certificate and attempt to get it revoked."" [Protonmail]"

Greetings to the developers and staff of Mozilla,"I met a problem in my android smartphone when I needed to go to the mail (gmail.com). The problem was switching another account. The same problem obviously through a computer browser (design mode). I understand that the error is Google, but still I believe that the browser must work even with such errors. I also encountered the problem of translating pages. Let's say from English to Russian. I have a google plugin. I think that it would be better if Mozilla had its own plugin and it was better than Google's. I see the pluses in you and I hope that the performance of your browsers will be better than Google and Apple, but when I see such errors, they unfortunately do not give such advantages. And I believe that it is necessary to work on the design of the browser for a greater desire to use and open it. I will be glad if listen to me. Thank you for your product."

"Why is javascript.enable missing from my config. settings, and how to fix?","In Win7, I have been running Firefox 60.9.0, the latest ESR version, for a while. I recently became aware that my system isn't receiving at any of my yahoo ""disposable addresses"" (including the one used here) so was checking that Javascript is enabled in Firefox. Going to the about:config page, I find no listing for ""Javascript.enabled"" although I have many lines beginning ""javascript.options. "" Does this new version somehow lack javascript ability, did my last upgrade somehow loose it, or was my system somehow corrupted since then? More importantly, what should I do to remedy the situation, that is, to enable javascript? I'm hoping that will also solve my mail problem."

Background opened tabs won't load until I open them 1 by 1 (When CPU is 100%),"When I open some tabs to the background, most of the times, none of them load in the background automatically, Unless I open them manually 1 by 1.My RAM is 16 GB!

Also the ""browser.tabs.unloadOnLowMemory"" in ""about:config"" is set to ""false"".My Firefox theme is the Default theme.I even tried Firefox in Safe Mode (with all addons disabled), But the problem still happened.My ""Windows 10"" & ""GPU driver"" are also up-to-date.This happens to me usually when My CPU is %100 (for doing other things like converting in the background). As soon as CPU usage goes lower than %100, The problem goes away.Enabling Hardware Acceleration in firefox, sometimes helps, But not always.Also I must say that I didn't have this problem before (maybe 1or 2 months ago), Until the last 2 or 3 versions of Firefox. So I'm sure its something to do with a new option that has been added to firefox lately."

"Firefox 52.2 ESR works mostly ok on CentOS-7, but fails to render math equations in Wikipedia. Works on other box. .CSS issue?","This question has been asked before, tried the solutions. Adblock disabled, cookies and cache cleared, theme set to default. About:config options tweaked to defaults. Specific example: This wikipedia site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations has math equations and matrix images, which fail to render. They appear briefly, then disappear. Flash plugin disabled. Perhaps default .CSS files altered? How to check this? Note: FF menu: Tools/Page-Info/Media shows equation images fine. Also, can click on blank part of screen where image is, and right-click ""view image"", and math equations/matrix images render ok. But page show only blank white space. Guys, this should not be this hard, here in 2019. Default .CSS might have been changed in my desperate attempts to change horrible bright-white page to a dark-theme. FIrefox with super-bright-white page is a bad experience, but blanked-out non-display-of-inline images, of course, makes Firefox sadly useless. If I can find the solution, I will post it here. This should *not* be this difficult. If the image can be rendered with a right-click to view it, the browser should just render that in-line in the page, and not display a blank white space, which it does now. This is an error that simply should not occur.Note: I enabled populating of the the ""Troubleshooting information"" field."

Landscape printing in Firefox 90° rotated,"Ubuntu 18.04, CUPS2.2.7, Firefox 69.0.2I use a custom web application that (among other functions) allows the print of labels. The labels are configured to the size of the label printers (3 printers, two label sizes). When I print the labels to a pdf file (print dialogue, ""Print to file""), output with correct orientation, size and content is produced. When I print the these labels from a pdf-viewer to the label printers, output is correct. However, when I print directly from Firefox to the label printers, the output is rotated by 90°. Labels from label printing software (glabels) are also printed correctly. On Windows, this is not an issue and printing works directly from Firefox.Apparently, the problem is caused by Firefox, but restricted to Linux (several computers).Any ideas on how to find the problem are appreciated.Many thanks in advance!"

Firefox crashes when trying to drag n drop multiple files,"Hi, I would like to point out that the drag n drop feature of Firefox is not really good.I have used many linux distribution and faced this problem from the day I started using Linux.

flash allowance,"Ok, I get it. Flash will be abandoned in 15 months time. Who can actually do something about this? The developers of sites that use flash. So why am I being punished? Why do I need to click 3 times additionally for something I have exactly zero, zip, null, no influence over whatsoever? Speaking about user friendliness, this is NOT it. Apart from downgrading or reverting to another browser that has not implemented this ridiculous anti-user-friendiness measure, what can I do?"
Constantly Logged Out,"Firefox is constantly logging me out of webpages even while I am on the page. For example, if I'm in gmail I will login and 2 minutes later it will log me out, even if I'm on the same page. The same happens with many other websites. I've been watching a YouTube video and been logged out halfway through the video too. For Salesforce I have to receive confirmation emails to confirm that I am the right person logging into the account. I've tried other solutions on these forums but nothing seems to work. I have my cookies to save and use custom settings for my history. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Native windows u2f dialog blocking content,I recently started using security keys and when I go to a website requiring login I get some kind of windows native prompt to touch the key. However it blocks the content behind it making me unable to change some preferences before logging in (remember me for e.g.).Interestingly I've tried on a different machine at my workplace and instead of a windows native window I get a small integrated prompt which doesn't have this usability issue. Both of the machines use Firefox 70.0 and windows 10. My copy of windows is 1903 (I don't know about the other machine). Is there an option in firefox not to use native security prompts from windows?

Firefox Crashes,"Every version of Firefox since 62.0.3 has been unstable on my system to the point of being completely useless. The crashes I suffer from were clearly introduced in the transition from 62.0.3 to 63.0, because every version from 63.0 to 70.0 has been unusable, and every time reverting to 62.0.3 gives me back a working browser. (By 'unusable' I mean crashing literally within a few seconds of starting up).However, 62.x is now so ancient that if I can't have a working version of Firefox soon I will have to give it up in favour of something more modern and secure!Please can you investigate and fix this issue!"

Upgrade to 70 removed all previously opened tabs. How can I recover them?,"I restarted Firefox after a reboot and had received the new update (70). I previously had opened tabs (I work a LOT with opened tabs). All of them were now gone. No option to recover previous sessions was under settings. Also, none of my add-ons were present.

So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?"

Premature blocking of Adobe Flash Player continues in FF 70,"I am going to keep saying this until someone in the development area responds with a REASONABLE reply.Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it. The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this. That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5. While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"". Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users. Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade. Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.Admit you ""jumped the gun"" and do the right thing by us."

"When running multiple profiles simultaneously, how to have Firefox updates in only one profile?","I'm a developer and always have multiple Firefox profiles running simultaneously from the same program/install directory. This generally works very well.The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles. I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.This is mostly just annoying. However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out. I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible. The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory. Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.Is there a way to have Firefox check for updates automatically, but only in my one main profile?Thanks,Charles"

how to move url bar out of navi toolbar to a different toolbar?,"Hello. For a long time i was laging after the world, because i simply don't like current firefox user interface, even though i was using this browser since 1.0 version. However i was always somehow able to customize it the way i wanted. Few years ago it become imposible when support for clasic theme restorer addon was droped and i was using esr releases ever since with some userchrome.css tweaks. But today update to version 68.2 broke everything i liked about the browser and things rearanged the way i hate. i am not dumb , i did try to get it back the way i wanted, but i got stuck on url bar placement, which is now imposible to move out of the navi toolbar.For most of the work i have used https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx code, for user chrome customization , but even they don't have options for url bar to be undocked, moved or removed.i was also trying to edit About:config toolbars order but after moving urlbar to different toolbar , for instance bookmarks or tabs string autocorect after restart and url bar is forced back on top.is there any way to make navigation toolbat in 2 rows or move adres bar someplace else?i attach my old screenshot and how it looks now"
How do I force Firefox to use my present location and not a cached location?,"I am a college student and I am required to use a website called Top Hat for one of my classes. With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading."
"The new search bar is useless. I need the old one back, it was one of the best features of Firefox. Why is it ruined now?","I used to abuse the old search bar like there was no tomorrow. I loved it. I think it was the soul of Firefox: it made everything so cool and easy. But somebody killed it. Fixed it when there was nothing to fix. Hope people who are working on new versions read this: people want the old one back. If you used the old search bar very often like I did, the new one behaves totally differently and thus makes using it a total pain. I have no understanding for this kind of change, especially when I cannot change it back anymore.Can somebody please point me to a working solution of how to get the old search box back? Showoneoffbuttons tweak in about:config doesn´t work anymore, Classic theme restorer doesn´t work either. I am getting sick and tired and I need help.Until some awesome person points me to a solution and I have showered them with praises and love (I am not being sarcastic, I am just stumped and any help is greatly appreciated), I downgrade Firefox into pre-Christ version and hope my virus program is up to the task.[Profanity removed by moderator.

"Lost all cookies, history, and saved passwords after downgrading","I was force updated to Firefox 70 and I didn't like the new layout for the new tab page, so I installed the .exe to downgrade to 69.0.3 . However, when I launched Firefox again, I lost all of my saved data on the browser and it was a fresh profile. Prior to downgrading, I had saved a copy of the Mozilla Firefox folder that is C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox just in case. Is there any way I could fix this and revert to the saved settings, extensions, and passwords that I previously had?Thank you in advance."

Firefox Constanly Crashing and Breaking Keyboard,"HiWell it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.Thank you"
Importing Bookmarks,"Can anyone out there help me, I've exported my FireFox Bookmarks onto an external hard drive and then copied them back onto the desktop and from there tried to import them back into FireFox.All the subfolders have imported back into FireFox no problem, but for some reason it has not done so with any bookmarks which appear under the Other Bookmarks listing, is there something I'm doing wrong?The version of FireFox I'm using is FireFox Quantum 6.9.0.3 (64 bit) with Windows 10."
Width of the tabs doesn't stay the same on FF70,"The more tabs I open, the narrower they are to fit in window, right?

Tabs are resizing instantly which is annoying. Here's my question: is there a setting in about:config that got resetted or something or FF70 doesn't have this function anymore? Thanks!"

"After My Computer Crashed Due to a Selective Power Failure, My Firefox Tabs Refuse to Completely Load.","After my computer lost power due to a selective power failure (we are not currently sure whether it was a blown fuse or something else), we Rebooted the computer after connecting the power cable to an outlet that works. Currently power is still of at both the original outlet, and several other outlets in the area, as well as a selective area downstairs.Upon booting up Firefox (I have it set so that it will reopen any tabs I was viewing upon shutdown or restart or crash) I noticed that it was taking longer to load than usual (even accounting for the large number of tabs I constantly have open), and then after it had loaded that I could not access any of that tabs. I can click on them, and they will be highlighted if moused over, but the only thing that shows is a white screen for the actual site. I have included a picture of this. I have come to the conclusion that this is a Firefox error, given I was able to restart and recover all of my Google Chrome Tabs.In addition to the Tabs not loading, Tabs to the left and right of the Tabs currently viewable are not accessible, and seem to almost not exist, if not for the lack of scroll arrows. In addition, scrolling left and/or right produces no response.Normally I would grab the crash file and reopen the tabs from that, but I don't know whether I currently can, and current Firefox issues noted below make me leery of trying.Upon noting that I could, I attempted to open a second Firefox session, and succeeded. However, in this session some of the same issues are occurring, mainly that I cannot search anything through the html bar, including opening websites by name (i.e. google.com produces but a blank white screen and no reaction), and there is no new tabs screen when I open a new tab (as I have set up in my settings to be the case). However, I can, for some reason, access sites from my bookmarks. The only way I was able to send this report is that Firefox automatically opened to a homepage when I opened the new session.Needless to say, I'm rather concerned. I love Firefox as a browser, and not being able to use it is both concerning and frustrating. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the matter.Many Thanks.P.S. If it at all helps (please disregard if it doesn't) the symbol that looks like a multi-forked branch on the modem is dark. I unfortunately do not know what that means."

Disabled Adaware and FF started opening properly.I don't want Adaware Secure Search however there is no Remove option in the dropdown. So, I started hunting online to try and remove it. It is not in the Control Panel. It is not in the registry - I searched in every folder. Ran MalwareBytes and other tools - they don't see Adaware Secure Search anywhere.I followed the instructions that required the use of Troubleshooting and found Adaware is also not in my FF profile (that I can tell - the .xpi files are difficult to figure out since the majority are in number value). Tried refreshing FF and it showed up again. Un/re-installed FF and there it is again!...but this time i had the ""joy"" of having to redo my tabs, etc. It isn't on my other browsers either, just FF.How do I get this removed?

Gmail problem after update to Catalina,"In the Gmail client, I often go to the drop down menu (3 vertical dots) and choose ""Filter messages like these"" to sort future emails into one of the many ""labels"" I use.

I then opened Google Chrome (see attached image), went to the same email in my Gmail client, and the feature worked. I suspect that the issue with using the feature in Firefox is that I upgraded to macOS 10.15 Catalina last night.

Saved passwords being replaced by Firefox-randomly-generated ones?,"Hi, I'm using Firefox 70 but also seeing this in Firefox 68.2 esr. We're seeing an issue where, when staff go to login to a particular website, their saved password is being autofilled with a randomly generated one. I had the staff go in to Firefox password management and delete the incorrect saved passwords. I had the staff member log back in to the site and enter their correct password to the website. They could log in, and Firefox would prompt the user if they wanted to save the password. But once again, the password that Firefox was prompting to save was a randomly-generated one and NOT the one the user just entered. Has anyone else seen this? The user was previously on a much older build of Firefox (somewhere in the 40s? not sure why it's not auto-updating either? Firefox had to update itself twice to get to the most current version.)

Questions about Content blocking in Firefox 70.,"There is a strange thing with Firefox Content blocking after Firefox 70 update - when I visit some site Firefox reports that it has tracking cookies but this cookies located in the list of blocked and allowed at the same time, also I saw purple shield in adress bar, so Firefox block something on this time.

Add-on or key for preventing/controlling cursor focus (specially in Gmail)?,"I am having trouble using Gmail. It's sluggish and its cursor focus behavior is enervating. I click a field and start typing, then Gmail, with its (or my computer's, or browser's) slowness takes a second or two to apply focus to its desired field, so it starts inputting my typing in the wrong field or worse, interpreting my inputs as actions (archiving, deleting, starring, muting conversations, opening chats, opening Google Tasks sidebar, deleting open draft, etc., really freaking messy). Example: I select a conversation, click the label button, click the label menu's text input field and start typing, then focus is removed from the field (and letters start activating those unwanted actions) and then finally Gmail apply focus to that same field, as if it' only now ready to accept input in it, even if I clicked it before.How can I prevent sites (or at least Gmail, specifically) from controlling/changing cursor focus? Is there an about:config key or an add-on for this, please?BTW, I don't mind Gmail and/or Firefox being a bit slow, I recognize I contribute to it by have a few add-ons installed and running (though not so many). What I don't want is Gmail choosing for me where my typing input is going."
My access to all Facebook content is being blocked since latest Firefox upgrade and I can't resolve the problem.,"Hello, I just upgraded to the latest version of Firefox today, and I am not at all happy about the new security settings. I find my access to Facebook content is completely blocked, whereas all other websites appear to be fine. Screenshot from one of the Facebook groups I follow is attached. I have spent hours trying to figure out your new security settings to enable access to Facebook, including switching off all blocking, and nothing is working, except to abandon Firefox and use Microsoft Edge (which is giving me perfect access). Also very ironically I have to use Microsoft Edge to log into Firefox support as Firefox tells me my cookies aren't enabled...except they are. I have been checking out Permissions to ensure everything is correctly enabled and I notice Load Images keeps reverting to Default rather than Enable – I don't know if this is significant. At any rate Facebook images and data are not loading and it is clear all the pages are being blocked. I also wonder why my Avast online security is not being recognised by Firefox at the moment. I have been happy to use Firefox as my default browser for at least the last 10 years, but this is ridiculous, and I hope there is a simple solution to these issues or I will be changing to a different browser. Thanks, Helen"

"Make FTP content displayed, instead of being saved (Firefox 70)","Hi,Since release of the Firefox 70 I noticed that all FTP content opened via direct links is being saved right away, instead of being displayed. As I understand, this was done to close this ""bug"": https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1560699. Though I guess this change can be beneficial for most users, it's also causing unnecessary problem to me a my colleagues at work.We are technical support team and we are working in the ticketing system called BMC Remedy. All file attachments sent by our customers are uploaded to our internal FTP server and then linked to the tickets via direct FTP links. Before release of the 70th version it was very convenient for us to click on those files, and get files opened straight inside browser. It worked flawlessly, especially for image and text files and saved us a lot of time. It was also the main reason we used Firefox, since in Chrome always (at least recently) saved files instead of displaying them.But the release of 70th version messed up everything for us, and now all the files need to be saved before they can be opened which causes a lot of inconvenience. So much so, we had to downgrade back to 69th version to work normally.As I said at the beginning, I do understand the reason behind this change since FTP vulnerabilities can harm users on public websites. However, inside closed environments like intranets there is no such threats, and losing ability to quickly preview FTP resources can hurt productivity. So in my opinion, while it's a good idea to have this behavior enabled by default, there should be an option under about:config to enable rendering of the FTP resources back. Or maybe someone at least can make an extension or Greasemonkey script that would bring this functionality back.I'm not sure if this is correct place, but I don't know where else to post this to bring attention to this problem."

How does Firefox know when I am visiting a site that has had a breach?,"I am not using Firefox Monitor, and I am running Firefox 66. I just visited a website, and was told via a popup message in the address bar there had been a breach back in 2010, exposing thousands of passwords. (And of course it suggested I sign up for Firefox Monitor to get details.)I am wondering how Firefox knew that it should show me that message? Does it regularly download a list of breached sites, or is every site I visit being sent to Mozilla so they can check to see whether it's on a breach list?I'm hoping it's not the latter as I never agreed to share my browsing history with Mozilla, or anyone else, but I can't find any information about how the browser maintains its list of breached sites."

That said, I am willing (with some misgivings) to assume that, somehow, I am not using the correct password. I can't imagine how that can be, but unless someone tells me otherwise, it seems that it kinda has to be the case. As such, since I'm still logged in, what I'd like to do is export all my data before requesting a password reset. Is there any way to do that?Thanks in advance."

I don't use Windows 10, so my OS can not enable a dark mode theme by default. So how can I force Firefox to go into dark mode manually? Note: I am talking about dark mode for the actual browser. Not webpages. Not Themes."

webpage interactive feature disabled,A webpage interactive feature is disabled - I checked about:config and javascript is 'enabled' which I understood to mean there should be no problem with interactive features.

key not using URL bar auto-suggestion,"When I type a few characters into the url bar, I see a list of completions from sites I've visited before, and the completion from the top match is highlighted in the URL bar. For example, if I type 'ny' into the search bar, I see a list of sites pop up with 'ny' in the url, and the URL bar itself now contains the original 'ny' characters followed by a highlighted string of 'times.com' since that's the site with nt in it that I've visited the most. So far, so good. The problem comes when I press <enter> however. Instead of taking me to the New York Times website as I intended, the browser reacts as if I only typed in ny in the search bar and hit <enter>, and it ignores the auto-suggestions that it just displayed. (In this case, it takes me to ny.com, which is not what I want). How do I get <enter> key presses to go to the completed url?

Chromeless Firefox,"I need Firefox Version 71.0 (64-bit) to open in a chromeless window with NO tabs, NO address bar, NO search bar, NO back/forward, NO menus, NO buttons, NO add-on icons, NO favorites, NO pocket menu, NOTHING but the title bar, window boarder, and the contents of the page that I'm viewing.

And why is there no way to disable+hide the use of tabs in ""Preferences""?. I spent the better part of two weeks searching the Internet (and Firefox add-ons) trying to find a way to achieve this chromeless experience. I remembered that there is JavaScript that will automatically open a webpage's popup window(s) in a chromeless mode. I found examples online and decided to create a local "".html"" file on my Linux Mint 19.2 (XFCE) system, add the code, then have Firefox open this local page (file:/home/user/Documents/index.html) instead of a online homepage. I disabled the ""Block pop-up windows"" option, and added the local ""index.html"" file to the exceptions. It didn't work. I checked the ""about:config"" settings in Firefox and found JavaScript to already be enabled. I used all the examples I found online, but none of them seem to work."

"Preferances aren't being preserved, other weird issues...","Hello everyone!Alright, there was maybe some trouble-shooting I skipped over however this had its reasoning. However onto the problem. I'm having the oddest behaviour out of my browser. My Add-Ons don't load, except for one. ( Dashlane Add-On ). The rest; ( AdBlocker Ultimate, ftt, hide tabs, image search options, and Tiled Group Tabs ); unfortunately only partially load. In this partial state, the browser identifies them as being active, the spot on the bar normally featuring the icon for these add-ons instead starts with an empty space.I should note that at this point, direct access to the internet is completely blocked. I've tried juggling around active add-ons and it doesn't really seem to matter. So this would have been where I'd have normally clean-slated and hit the magic refresh button and uninstall and reinstall just to be safe. However I found a work around, that might provide some level of what's going on. When I open the browser, I open the add-on section and go through add-ons toggling their ability to access private tabs and then for the remaining session they all work and work entirely fine.Unfortunately, with my limited knowledge most of the debug information is above my head. I do know that I have to give permission to the add-ons again and options set within the add-ons screen are all reset to default. I would really love a solution to this, since the agony of the reset button appeals less than actually getting help to fix a problem. Perhaps helping others who may in future or now have the same problem.Anyhow... note in a bottle... cast away into the ocean of the internet. Here's hoping I catch some good advice. :3If you've read this far, thanks. If you can help, please? lol."

Pinned tabs keep randomly unpinning when working with them.,"This has been going on ever since pinned tabs feature was implemented. Pinned tabs are so unstable that they are basically useless. Currently pinned tabs are unpinning themselves when I load and work in forms on the corresponding pages. I'm not accidentally unpinning them. It's happening spontaneously for no apparent reason. It isn't related to any tab extensions. I am certain of this because I have disabled all of them and it still keeps happening. Click tab, work on page, click other tab to do form work on other tab, go back to previous tab and it's not there because it's unpinned. It's gotten maddening to be perfectly honest as there doesn't appear to be any solution to the problem and I've honestly reached the point after this feature being so unstable for so long that I don't understand why the feature even exists since it's never worked reliably sine it's inception. What's going on with this? I used to be able to use tab locking addons that worked far better than this but now no one is able to make them due to the changes. Is this ever going to improve or should I just give up dreaming?"

But when you use it to create a Firefox account, we can protect your privacy across more of your online life.""I don't know why they say that - you have to register w/ an email to post or reply on any of the support forums or addon forum or to review addons or to file bugs on bugzilla.How is the sign in / authentication process different for Firefox Accts than registering on the Mozilla support site?Exactly what method are they using to register users or recognize them in different sessions?Are they using oAuth or anything similar?If so, what data are they attempting to gather about the users, their system, device(s) or any personal / pseudo-personal data? Not that oAuth is ""safe"" (it had & has a number of security bugs). But sites using it (according to Google) can adjust what data they try to gather.Thanks."

Used Edge to google tips, opened FF in FF safe mode, and that lost the links.Reopened FF and viewed history where I found the bad link many times.

libxul.so on-disk corruption observed on 2 different platforms,"I'm not sure I would have believed this if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.Symptom: One day, out of nowhere and not pursuant to any user-initiated Firefox installation, configuration or plugin change, a deterministic set of websites begins to crash tabs immediately on page load. Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash. If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in. Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected. Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart. Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem.I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time. This happened three times in the last six months. As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on.Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop:/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:19:56 achpee kernel: [3642722.464002] Web Content[17741]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f6881995024 sp 00007ffd2548d010 error 6 in libxul.so[7f687d5ad000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:20:40 achpee kernel: [3642765.713880] Web Content[18209]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f2f71605024 sp 00007fff08ecc490 error 6 in libxul.so[7f2f6d21d000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 18:20:53 achpee kernel: [3642778.682450] Web Content[18253]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f46d16fd024 sp 00007ffdf062b6e0 error 6 in libxul.so[7f46cd315000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 21:18:29 achpee kernel: [3653435.096133] Web Content[27212]: segfault at 3 ip 00007f081696d024 sp 00007ffd774ee3e0 error 6 in libxul.so[7f0812585000+4665000]/var/log/syslog.1:Jan 5 21:19:52 achpee kernel: [3653518.422883] Web Content[28191]: segfault at 3 ip 00007faa3c23d024 sp 00007ffe1e89e1c0 error 6 in libxul.so[7faa37e55000+4665000]No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation. On a Linux box? Seriously? Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting).By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime. Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached.I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms. Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray? No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday. That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites:$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l32There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling.Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind?"

Menu key on keyboard vs Right mouse button,"Hi,I found that RMB (right mouse button) context menu and Menu Key (located between alt and ctrl) are different (see attached images).There are some websites that change the context menu that is visible under right mouse button. When I am writing a lot I use context menu button instead (for example for spelling corrections). In some cases the keyboard button shows the default (useless) context menu. How to set the menu key to display the same context menu as right mouse button? Or maybe there is a shortcut key to display the correct context menu?"

the default file manager for downloads folder and open containing folder changed,"Using Ubuntu 19.10. I recently installed the kde plasma desktop as an option so I could log off and then log in to a user I created specifically to use the KDE Plasma desktop and applications. While in Ubuntu using Gnome as the default desktop all other browsers, Chrome, Brave, Opera etc use Nautilus to open the containing folder as they should since Nautilus is the default inode/directory setting and the default file manager for Gnome. Firefox however for reasons only known to God and hopefully you guys, has chosen to use Dolphin instead of Nautilus. I always have the option of just using a different browser as my default which I may wind up doing if you can't or won't fix your issue but I am hoping it is something simple I can do on my end. Any suggestions?"

Lately, when I click on an embedded email link, such as an email address displayed on a website, rather than opening Thunderbird directly, internet explorer opens a dialogue box and asks me to confirm to open Thunderbird, which then results in a crash, as IE continues to open the dialogue box several times at once.

"Firefox Developer Edition (version 73.0b2, 64-bit) - Autoplay persists despite turning it off via options...","So I was looking at a Facebook group this morning and saw something that was posted in the group's feed that decided to autoplay on it's own despite ""Block Audio and Video"" being the default within the ""Settings - Autoplay"" screen.I don't understand why this is constantly an issue with Firefox. Every single time, every update, every install, it always and continually becomes an issue with websites that I visit with Firefox. Even a completely fresh install with that above-mentioned setting, it's still an issue--nothing to do with customization of any kind, it's just that Firefox isn't doing what it's supposed to do.What's going on here with this? Why isn't Firefox able to stop autoplay of videos within Facebook? I shouldn't have to rely on website settings to turn something like that off when it's the browser that allows the playback. I'm clearly missing something (I guess) so I'd appreciate if someone can shine some light on this because it's infuriating."
How to recover a deleted profile in Windows 7 after the Recycle Bin has been emptied?,"I used Recuva to recover the Recycle Bin files, most of which are recoverable as it was emptied recently, but I don't know which are Firefox files.

And how do I prevent my (small) C drive from filling up in the Users area? I have the browser installed on D drive but I can't remember if I attempted to install it as a portable installation. I think that might prevent the Users area filling up on C driver or would it fill up on a portable install? I don't even know if Mozilla offers a portable install. I just hate it when software scatters files all over the place. I want everything Firefox related in one folder. Most of the time software is like a filing system where you place your carefully organized papers into a tray and its shot out spewing the contents all over the room."

Web pages get stuck on 'Looking up...' and cycle through a lot of unrelated pages,"Hello,My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees.

At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as www.google.com etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up 'www.ikea.com' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following:Looking up www.ikea.comLooking up fonts.googleapis.comLooking up www.googletagmanager.comLooking up www.facebook.comRead s.salecycle.comLooking up www.facebook.comLooking up (numbers and letters).cloudfront.netLooking up www.google-analytics.comTLS handshake with i.salecycle.comSending i.salecycle.comLooking up www.google-analytics.comWaiting for www.google-analytics.comI don't have this problem with anything else connected to the network - I tested the WiFi connection just now on my Xbox and got 35.73, 34.31 and 35.94mb/s, but trying to load broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk on Firefox took 16m 13s just to load the page, and it's not even got near to starting the test.

Firefox is a corrupt organization. Here is why,"While back, firefox users got outraged due to bookmakrs comment section was removed.Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?WTF ?I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?What the hell are you talking about ?YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have."

PayPal checkout popup window loads indefinitely; cannot make a payment,"When using the ""Checkout with PayPal"" button on websites the PayPal popup window appears however it's impossible to progress to the checkout.When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.paypal.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('https://www.paypal.com').' error.I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same.I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required). These settings have not been changed since the file has been created.The following actions have been tried and didn't improve the situation:- refreshing the current profile- disabling all addins- adding paypal.com into exclusions for 'Block pop-up windows' and Enhanced Tracking Protection- cleaning History and cookiesI then launched Firefox with a separate 'clean' profile and was able to make the payment successfully. Sure enough, importing my user.js file broke PayPal. I went through the settings commenting them out by groups.The following setting was causing the issue:user_pref(""privacy.firstparty.isolate"", true);Setting it to 'false' made the PayPal popup window work correctly again.Thought that this would be helpful for anyone experiencing similar issues. Cheers."

"Unexpected behavior with ""jump to end of word"" keyboard shortcut on macOS","I often use the ""Option+Left/Right Arrow"" keyboard shortcut to navigate through text.In Chrome and other programs, this works how I would expect it: using this site, the first press of the right arrow will move the cursors after ""https"" and before the "":"" character.

"How do I force firefox delete all cookies and site data when I close it, without forbidding remembering them?","Hello.I want Firefox to delete all data, which means cookies and site data, when I close all Firefox's windows. But since I migrated to win10, I've been experiencing a trouble.Back in my win7 environment, things were working as intended. I went to ""about:preferences#privacy"". Then on ""Cookies and Site Data"" section, I ticked ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed."" And on ""History"" section, I chose ""Firefox will Use custom settings for history"". And I ticked ""Clear history when Firefox closes"". Also I ticked all boxes on ""Settings for Clearing History"" window.All data seemed deleted when I closed Firefox back then.But things were changed in a weird way. The settings on ""History"" section is working but I've noticed some leftovers. All cookies are gone and you're logged out, but I noticed that some sites STILL have some settings. A example is ""tenki.jp"", which is a weather forecast page. I opened a page of a location, and close Firefox, and start Firefox, and went to the top page, but it still remembers the location which I checked earlier.The setting on ""Coolies and Site Data"" section is worse. It works, but not in the intended way. I opened a page of a location on the weather forecast site, and went to the top page, it of-course remembered the location. But I opened the top page on ANOTHER TAB, it forgets the location. It seems like Firefox shares cookies and log-in information between tabs, but don't shares this sort of data when the setting is ticked.I don't understand what is going on. All I know is that some sites uses ""that sort of data"", which is not cookies and site data apparently, to store site settings, and Firefox can't handle them well.If you know a solution, please let me know.I'm using 72.0.2 64bit on Windows 10 Pro 64bit Japanese.Thanks."

New tab page (top sites page) is missing top margin (not centered vertically),"Hello Mozilla fellows.Yesterday a top margin of the ""New tab"" page (""top sites"" etc. page) suddenly became missing (not centered vertically) in my Firefox 73.0. This page displays broken for any Firefox profile (for Firefox instances of other users of the same Windows), so resetting (""refreshing"") Firefox is not a solution, and most simple Firefox reinstallation also did not help. (I believe there are no screenshot needed here, as anybody knows what is a large top margin of a centered [div] entity, and how does its absence should look.)My desktop AMD A6 computer where Firefox got this problem is maintained pretty ""default"" - Windows is strictly genuine out-of-the-box, there was no any errors caught of any custom settings invoked during any software installations, every software unit in Windows is free of charge (no stolen software at all), all hardware drivers are ok, desktop graphics are set to usual 1920x1080 32bpp Windows Aero, and I even did not use any realtime antiviruses for years. There are also no any add-ons\extensions\plugins\themes in Firefox, and no Flash or Java installed.A similar question (№ 1268604) already exists here for a few months, but I decided to also begin a new thread for the issue, because the problem is quite sensitive for me - I do not want to reset entire PC to get rid of this tiny bug, even though I guess this would help a bit :)Can anybody clearly explain me, what and why has changed in my Firefox files yesterday and how can I fix this by any obvious tiny configuration actions or something alike?

Restore session doesn't work after update,"I have a very high tab count, and when restoring Firefox I usually get the ""warning:unresponsive script"" pop up.

I have no idea what's causing this, and haven't found this problem anywhere else.I would also note that it starts the tab with the code http://david and that eventually forwards to this."
Blank search bar automatically fills in old searches,"I have my search bar set to use Google. I like the search suggestions option so I want to leave that on. But if I leave the search bar blank, after a few minutes it will automatically fill in a randomly picked old search from the previous few weeks. Erase the search suggestion, and a few minutes later, another, different, randomly picked old search. It's like a roulette wheel seeking to choose which old search might be the most embarrassing. This seems to be a recent development, I think within the last month or so.Is it too much to ask for a blank search bar to remain blank?I am aware that turning off search suggestions entirely will turn off this behavior. As I said before, I like search suggestions except for this one thing, and want to be able to leave search suggestions on."

how to stay logged in to Firefox all the time forever,"Only on this one computer do I frequently find I am no longer logged in to my Firefox account. I get that warning sign in the top right corner of the screen and it invites me to log in so I can sync with my other devices.If there's a cookie I need to tell Ccleaner to ignore, tell me which it is. This morning I logged in again when I saw I was not logged into my Firefox account. I also updated Flashplayer or somesuch from Adobe. Maybe that's what logged me off. Then again, I had to restart my browser to complete the install of the Adobe. Ccleaner would have kicked in then. Thanks!"
Firefox73.0 Lockwise not listing saved passwords and logins,"Overnight it seems that Firefox is no longer reading my old saved logins and passwords. I have checked to see that the logins.json and key4.db files are present, but the new Lockwise page shows nothing. When I look at the about:protections page, it shows that I still have 400+ logins and passwords protected. I tried to make a new profile and import backup data and Firefox still does not see the saved logins and passwords in the new profile. Any ideas on what is causing this behavior? I have so many accounts, and would like to get this functionality working again."

Options - General - Applications is missing Content Types,"I've seen a few other posts on this problem, but none of them seem to direct me on how to actually solve it. Recently many machines in my environment have lost most Application Content Types. Usually defaulting to only IRC, IRCS, and MAILTO; nothing else. A few applications have popped into the FF install on my PC, but I can't figure out how to force an app in there. I've seen a post that details how to add something manually, but I am not exactly keen on manually adding everything to a few dozen machines. I've been pushing my end users to use Chrome for the time being, something I'd rather not do.Any help would be appreciated."

Mult-Account Container - can't rename container,"If I try to rename a container - Edit Container, select the pencil icon - edit the name, it appears to work but when I hit Enter or the back button it is not renamed. Restart firefox and it is still not renamed. This is version 6.2.1 of the extension I posted this previously but it was marked a duplicate https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1279756It isn't even remotely a duplicate other than it uses the same extension provided by Mozilla. If this isn't the best place to report these issues than why not tell me where to do so rather than marking a unique question a dupe?"

How do I fix audio static problems on Twitch?,"When watching Twitch (music) streamers there has always (for most streams) been a lag, or even a stop, in the stream when I open the emotes-for-chat pop-up. About two months ago, in addition to the lag or stopping, when the stream starts up again I sometimes have audio static that doesn't go away unless I reload the page. (I only recently found I'm not the only one with this issue.) But even doing that often doesn't work once I click the emote pop-up again. I've tried resetting everything, I've tried disabling add-ons, basically I've tried all the standard stuff listed in the trouble-shooting guides but nothing seemed to solve the problem. I'm not sure why the streams (audio & video) stop when I click the emotes, which has always been an issue but usually just clicking the low-latency button - twice! - solves that issue. This audio static seems to be a whole different thing because reloading the page is the only way I've found to get rid of that problem and then it often happens again when I click the emotes pop-up. Any help out there?"
How to control url suggestions?,"Is there any way to control specific url selections?90% of the time i am using a browser, i am using one site (drive.google.com). But when i type in ""d"" the suggested url is ALWAYS 'docs.google.com' (see screenshots). It seems to be getting this from the url of individual documents in the history, as i NEVER use or want to go to 'docs.google.com', as it is just a less featured and organized version of 'drive.google.com'. But i can't seem to delete it! I would like to be able to have url suggestions from history, but not this specific one!I am trying to migrate over to firefox from chrome, and as silly as it sounds i can't do that if typing in ""d"" doesn't get to my most-accessed site. It's really annoying to keep accidentally going to 'docs.google.com'."

Can someone help me with the PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR,"I am facing this PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR problem from last 15 days, I tried EVERY possible solutions posted in different community supports (Microsoft, and firefox) and also checked every possible article on this problem but none of those helped me. I see firefox tries to do some ""TLS handshake with the server"" everytime before this problem apperars. Then I tried a solution provided by a user in microsoft community, the suggested me to switch the proxy setting to ""Auto detect proxy for this site"" and ""Enable DNS over https"", and it was working for me. But from last 2 days I started facing the same issue again. The webpages only works when I start Firefox in Safe Mode. It's so frustrating and makes it impossible to use Firefox. And leaves me with no other option but to use Microsoft Edge. I really like Firefox so wanted to know if anyone could help me fix this issue with something New and Effective."
